# ⚡ Divine Council Session - TOTO Project

**Session Date:** 2025-07-29  
**Project:** TOTO - Intelligent Image Evolution Platform  
**Council Members:** Zeus, Daedalus, Apollo, Hephaestus, Themis, Aegis, Prometheus, Hermes

---

## 📋 **Session Transcript**

### **Initial Vision Presentation**
**User Request:** AI image generation platform using:
- Stable Diffusion Flux model via URL endpoint
- Free tier to start
- Metaprompt-driven 4-axis enhancement system
- Iterative user selection → new variations workflow
- Intelligent prompt evolution (not random variations)

---

### **🌩️ Zeus - Strategic Analysis**
*"A worthy challenge! This requires careful orchestration of AI models, user experience, and iterative workflows. The technical complexity demands our finest architects."*

**Key Insights:**
- Project addresses real pain point in AI generation (chaos vs. guided evolution)
- Strategic differentiator: Intelligent metaprompt system
- Requires multi-disciplinary coordination

---

### **🏗️ Daedalus - Architecture Vision**
*"I see the architecture clearly - we need a workflow engine to manage iterative states, API orchestration for SD Flux, and intelligent prompt enhancement pipelines. The metaprompt system is the key innovation here."*

**Technical Contributions:**
- Designed 3-tier architecture (Frontend → Workflow Engine → SD Flux API)
- Identified core components: State Manager, Prompt Engine, Queue System
- Proposed technology stack: Node.js/TypeScript, React/Next.js, PostgreSQL/Redis

---

### **🎨 Apollo - User Experience Design**
*"The user experience must be seamless! Four-image selection grids, smooth iteration flows, and visual prompt evolution tracking. Users should feel like they're sculpting their perfect image."*

**UX Contributions:**
- Designed user journey flow with clear iteration patterns
- Proposed evolution tree visualization for tracking progress
- Interface features: Grid selection, prompt inspector, quick actions

---

### **💻 Hephaestus - Implementation Strategy**
*"I can build this! The prompt engineering system, SD Flux integration, and state management. We'll need careful API design and efficient image handling."*

**Development Contributions:**
- Defined TypeScript interfaces for core systems
- Specified API endpoint structure
- Planned metaprompt engine architecture
- Queue-based generation system design

---

### **⚖️ Themis - Quality Assurance**
**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for metaprompt algorithms
- Integration tests for full user workflows
- Load testing for concurrent generation
- Quality metrics: >95% success rate, <3s response time

---

### **🛡️ Aegis - Security & Compliance**
**Security Measures:**
- Content safety filtering
- API rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Data protection and GDPR compliance
- Cost protection through quotas

---

### **🎯 Prometheus - Product Strategy**
**Business Model:**
- Free tier: 20 generations/day
- Pro tier: Unlimited + advanced features
- Enterprise: API access + team collaboration

**Target Market:** Creative professionals, content creators, AI enthusiasts

---

### **🗓️ Hermes - Project Planning**
**Development Roadmap:**
- Phase 1 (4 weeks): MVP with core features
- Phase 2 (3 weeks): Enhanced UI and optimization
- Phase 3 (3 weeks): Pro tier and scaling
- Phase 4 (4 weeks): Advanced features and enterprise

---

## 🎯 **Council Decisions**

### **Approved Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js with responsive grid interface
- **Backend:** Node.js/TypeScript with Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Redis caching
- **Queue:** Bull/BullMQ for async processing
- **Storage:** Cloud storage with CDN

### **Core Innovation:**
Metaprompt engine with 4-axis enhancement:
1. **Style Axis** - Artistic style variations
2. **Mood Axis** - Emotional tone adjustments
3. **Detail Axis** - Complexity and detail levels
4. **Composition Axis** - Framing and perspective

### **Success Metrics:**
- User retention through iterations > 80%
- Generation success rate > 95%
- Average session length > 10 minutes
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5
