## FEATURE: RESTful API with Versioning

Robust API infrastructure for mobile clients:

- RESTful endpoints with consistent naming
- API versioning strategy (URL-based)
- Request/response compression
- Pagination with cursor-based navigation
- Field filtering and sparse fieldsets
- HATEOAS for discoverability
- Batch operations for efficiency

[HIGH PRIORITY]

## FEATURE: User Authentication System

Secure mobile-optimized authentication:

- JWT-based authentication
- Refresh token rotation
- Biometric authentication support
- Social login (Apple, Google, Facebook)
- Device fingerprinting and management
- Passwordless authentication options
- Account recovery flows

[HIGH PRIORITY]

## FEATURE: Push Notification Service

Cross-platform push notification system:

## DOCUMENTATION:

- `https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging`: FCM documentation
- `https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications`: APNS guide
- `https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519`: JWT specification
- `https://socket.io/docs/`: Socket.IO documentation
- `https://docs.aws.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/`: S3 for media storage

## CONSTRAINTS:

- API response time < 500ms (p95)
- Support iOS 13+ and Android 6+
- Bandwidth optimization for cellular networks
- Battery-efficient background operations
- GDPR and CCPA compliance
- App store review compliance
- Backward compatibility for 3 versions
- 99.9% API availability

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

Mobile-specific optimizations:
- Implement request batching to reduce network calls
- Use Protocol Buffers for smaller payload sizes
- Implement smart prefetching based on user patterns
- Cache strategy considering device storage limits
- Network quality adaptation (2G/3G/4G/5G/WiFi)
- Geographic edge servers for global users

Security considerations:
- Certificate pinning for added security
- Obfuscation of sensitive endpoints
- Rate limiting per device
- Jailbreak/root detection
- App attestation (SafetyNet, DeviceCheck)

Platform-specific features:
- iOS: Background fetch, widgets, App Clips
- Android: Work profiles, instant apps
- Cross-platform: React Native/Flutter support
- Deep linking and universal links
- App indexing for search
