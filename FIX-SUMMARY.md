# Divine Council Fix - Missing Tools

## Problem
The divine council and Zeus agents were missing critical tools:
- ❌ No `bash` tool = couldn't create directories or run git commands
- ❌ No `web_search` tool = couldn't research best practices

This is why the council:
- Didn't ask about project type, git, GitHub
- Didn't create directories automatically
- Didn't initialize git
- Didn't show real-time progress

## Solution
Added missing tools to:
- `divine-council.md`: Added `bash` and `web_search`
- `zeus.md`: Added `bash` and `web_search`

## Now the Divine Council Will:
1. ✅ Ask for project name
2. ✅ Ask for project type (1-6)
3. ✅ Ask about git initialization
4. ✅ Ask about GitHub repo creation
5. ✅ Create directories automatically with `bash`
6. ✅ Initialize git with `bash`
7. ✅ Create GitHub repo with `bash` and `gh`
8. ✅ Show real-time progress
9. ✅ Research best practices with `web_search`

The system should now work as designed!
