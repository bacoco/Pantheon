## FEATURE: Command System

A comprehensive command system for software development assistance:

- Task complexity analysis across multiple dimensions
- Multi-agent orchestration for diverse perspectives
- Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) generation
- Pattern learning and memory storage
- Extensible command architecture

[HIGH PRIORITY]

## FEATURE: Agent Transformation System

Dynamic specialist agents with unique capabilities:

- On-demand agent transformation with *agent commands
- Specialized personas (Architect, Developer, QA, Security)
- Context-aware responses based on expertise
- Agent-specific commands and actions
- Team coordination capabilities

[HIGH PRIORITY]

## FEATURE: Structured Project Definition

Simplified workflow using baco.md files:

- YAML frontmatter for metadata
- Multiple features with dependencies and priorities
- Example code pattern detection
- Constraint specification
- Auto-discovery of conventions

Dependencies: Command System

## FEATURE: Pattern Learning and Memory

Intelligent pattern recognition and storage:

- Successful implementation pattern detection
- Context-based pattern retrieval
- Continuous learning from user interactions
- Pattern applicability analysis

Dependencies: Command System

[LOW PRIORITY]

## EXAMPLES:

- `.claude/commands/analyze.md`: Command implementation pattern
- `.claude/agents/architect.md`: Agent persona definition
- `.claude/utils/baco-parser.md`: Parser instruction format
- `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md`: Multi-agent coordination

## DOCUMENTATION:

- `https://claude.ai/docs`: Claude Code documentation
- `https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-ai`: AI safety principles
- `https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code`: Claude Code examples
- `https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073`: Constitutional AI paper

## CONSTRAINTS:

- Must run entirely within Claude Code environment
- No external API calls or dependencies
- Maintain prompt-based architecture (no executable code)
- Support both CLI-style and conversational interactions
- Preserve session context between commands
- Follow Claude's constitutional AI principles

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

Pantheon is designed as a prompt-based system where all logic is implemented through markdown instructions that Claude interprets. Key architectural decisions:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Commands, agents, and utilities in separate directories
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new commands and agents
- **Transparency**: Users can inspect and modify all prompts
- **No Hidden State**: All context visible in conversation
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple commands for beginners, advanced features for experts

The system should feel like a natural extension of Claude Code while providing powerful orchestration capabilities for complex software development tasks.
