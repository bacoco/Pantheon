## FEATURE: Service Discovery and Routing

Dynamic service discovery and intelligent routing:

- Kubernetes service discovery integration
- Load balancing strategies (round-robin, least connections, weighted)
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Request routing based on headers/path/method
- Canary deployments support
- Blue-green deployment routing

[HIGH PRIORITY]

## FEATURE: Authentication and Authorization

Centralized security layer:

- JWT validation and parsing
- OAuth2/OIDC integration
- API key management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Service-to-service authentication (mTLS)
- Token refresh handling
- Security policy enforcement

[HIGH PRIORITY]

## FEATURE: Rate Limiting and Throttling

Traffic control and protection:

- Multiple rate limiting strategies (fixed window, sliding window, token bucket)
- Per-user/API key/IP rate limits
- Distributed rate limiting with Redis
- Burst allowance configuration
- Rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-*)
- Graceful degradation
- DDoS protection

Dependencies: Authentication and Authorization

[HIGH PRIORITY]

## FEATURE: Request/Response Transformation

Protocol and data transformation:

- Request/response header manipulation
- Body transformation (JSON, XML, Protocol Buffers)
- Protocol translation (REST to GraphQL)
- Request aggregation from multiple services
- Response caching strategies
- Compression (gzip, brotli)
- Content negotiation

## FEATURE: Monitoring and Observability

Comprehensive visibility into API traffic:

- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus)
- Structured logging (ELK stack)
- Real-time analytics dashboard
- SLA monitoring and alerting
- Error tracking and debugging
- Performance profiling

[MEDIUM PRIORITY]

## FEATURE: API Documentation Portal

Developer experience features:

- Auto-generated API documentation
- Interactive API explorer
- Code sample generation
- SDK downloads
- Change logs and versioning
- API usage analytics
- Developer onboarding flow

Dependencies: Service Discovery and Routing

[MEDIUM PRIORITY]

## FEATURE: Traffic Management

Advanced traffic control features:

- A/B testing support
- Shadow traffic (traffic mirroring)
- Request validation
- Response validation
- Timeout management
- Bulkhead pattern
- Priority queuing

Dependencies: Service Discovery and Routing, Monitoring and Observability

## FEATURE: Plugin System

Extensible middleware architecture:

- Plugin marketplace
- Custom plugin development SDK
- Hot-reload plugin updates
- Plugin isolation and sandboxing
- Performance impact monitoring
- Plugin versioning
- Configuration management

[LOW PRIORITY]

## EXAMPLES:
