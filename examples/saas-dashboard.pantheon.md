## EXAMPLES:

- `./examples/tenant-middleware.ts`: Express middleware for tenant isolation
- `./examples/rbac-implementation.ts`: Role-based access control
- `./examples/stripe-webhooks.ts`: Subscription lifecycle handling
- `./examples/analytics-widget.tsx`: React dashboard widget component
- `./examples/api-rate-limiter.ts`: Redis-based rate limiting

## DOCUMENTATION:

- `https://stripe.com/docs/billing`: Stripe Billing
- `https://auth0.com/docs`: Auth0 authentication
- `https://www.postgresql.org/docs/`: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security
- `https://grafana.com/docs/`: Grafana for metrics
- `https://swagger.io/docs/`: OpenAPI specification

## CONSTRAINTS:

- 99.99% uptime SLA
- Data residency compliance (EU, US, APAC)
- SOC 2 Type II compliance
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- < 200ms API response time (p95)
- Support for 10,000+ tenants
- Horizontal scalability
- Zero-downtime deployments

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

Enterprise features to consider:
- White-labeling capabilities for larger customers
- Custom integrations via iPaaS platforms
- Advanced security features (IP allowlisting, SIEM integration)
- Dedicated infrastructure options for enterprise clients
- Compliance certifications (ISO 27001, HIPAA)
- 24/7 support with SLA guarantees

Technical architecture considerations:
- Use Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling
- Implement Circuit Breaker pattern for external services
- Message queuing for async operations (RabbitMQ/SQS)
- Caching strategy with Redis
- CDN for static assets
- Database read replicas for analytics queries
- Event sourcing for audit trail
- Feature toggles for gradual rollouts
