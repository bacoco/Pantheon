## FEATURE: User Authentication System

A comprehensive user authentication system that supports registration, login, logout,
and session management. This feature should include:

- User registration with email verification
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT-based authentication for API access
- Session management with refresh tokens
- Password reset functionality
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

[HIGH PRIORITY]

## FEATURE: Task Management API

CRUD operations for task management where users can create, read, update, and delete
their personal tasks. Each task should have:

- Title and description
- Due date and priority level
- Status tracking (pending, in-progress, completed)
- Tags for categorization
- File attachments support

Dependencies: User Authentication System

## FEATURE: Real-time Notifications

[LOW PRIORITY] WebSocket-based real-time notifications for task updates and reminders.
Users should receive notifications for:

- Task assignments
- Approaching due dates
- Status changes
- Comments on tasks

Dependencies: User Authentication System, Task Management API

## EXAMPLES:

- `./examples/fastapi_auth.py`: FastAPI authentication implementation with JWT
- `./examples/sqlalchemy_models.py`: SQLAlchemy models for users and tasks
- `./examples/websocket_handler.py`: WebSocket implementation for real-time features
- `./examples/test_auth.py`: Comprehensive authentication testing patterns

```python
# Inline example of desired API structure
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer

app = FastAPI(title="Task Manager API")
security = HTTPBearer()

@app.post("/api/v1/auth/register")
async def register(user_data: UserCreate):
    """Register a new user with email verification."""
    pass

@app.post("/api/v1/tasks", dependencies=[Depends(security)])
async def create_task(task: TaskCreate, current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    """Create a new task for the authenticated user."""
    pass
```

## DOCUMENTATION:

- `https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/`: FastAPI framework documentation
- `https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/`: SQLAlchemy ORM documentation  
- `https://jwt.io/introduction/`: JWT authentication guide
- `https://python-socketio.readthedocs.io/`: Socket.IO for Python

## CONSTRAINTS:

- Must use PostgreSQL as the database backend
- All passwords must be hashed using bcrypt with a minimum work factor of 12
- JWT tokens must expire after 30 minutes with refresh token support
- API must follow RESTful conventions with proper HTTP status codes
- All endpoints must have comprehensive input validation
- Database queries must be optimized to handle 10,000+ users
- WebSocket connections must be authenticated
- File uploads limited to 10MB per file

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

This project will be deployed on AWS using Docker containers. Consider:

- Environment-based configuration management
- Structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- Database migration strategy using Alembic
- API versioning strategy for future updates
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS configuration for frontend integration
- Comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

The authentication system is critical and must be thoroughly tested with both
unit tests and integration tests. Pay special attention to security best practices
and OWASP guidelines.
