# BACO Implementation Summary - Phases 1-3 Complete

## Understanding BACO Architecture

**BACO is a prompt-based orchestration system** that runs entirely within Claude Code. It consists of:
- **Markdown instruction files** that tell Claude how to behave
- **No executable code** - everything is interpreted by Claude
- **Integration with existing BACO commands** through shared context

## What's Been Implemented

### âœ… Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. **Schema Definition** (`/.claude/schemas/baco-in-schema.yaml`)
   - Comprehensive YAML schema for baco.in validation
   - Support for YAML frontmatter with metadata
   - Validation rules for all sections

2. **Parser Instructions** (`/.claude/utils/baco-parser.md`)
   - Instructions for Claude to parse baco.in files
   - How to extract YAML frontmatter
   - How to identify sections (features, examples, documentation, constraints)
   - Error message templates for helpful feedback
   - Guidelines for auto-discovery suggestions

3. **BACO Command Instructions** (`/.claude/commands/baco.md`)
   - `/baco init` - Shows template for users to create baco.in
   - `/baco plan` - Analyzes baco.in and generates development plan
   - `/baco validate` - Checks baco.in structure and reports issues
   - `/baco execute` - Creates comprehensive PRP from baco.in
   - Maintains compatibility with direct command usage

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated main `baco.md` with new workflow information
   - Enhanced `/help` command with baco.in documentation
   - Created comprehensive example file
   - Added integration guidance

### âœ… Phase 2: Multi-Feature Support
1. **Multiple Features** - Instructions handle multiple FEATURE sections
2. **Feature Dependencies** - Features can declare dependencies on other features
3. **Priority Levels** - Features support HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority markers
4. **Constraints Section** - Instructions for parsing technical requirements

### âœ… Phase 3: Example Analysis System
1. **Example Analyzer Instructions** (`/.claude/utils/example-analyzer.md`)
   - How to detect coding conventions from descriptions
   - Pattern recognition guidelines
   - Auto-discovery suggestions when examples are missing
   - Synthesis and recommendation format

2. **Integration with Planning**
   - Development plans now include detected conventions
   - Team composition based on requirements analysis
   - Example relevance matching for features

## Key Features Implemented

### The baco.in File Format
```yaml
---
version: 1.0
project_type: "FastAPI Web Service"
author: "Your Name"
---

## FEATURE: Feature Name
Feature description with optional [HIGH PRIORITY] marker
Dependencies: Other Feature Name

## EXAMPLES:
- `./examples/file.py`: Description
- Inline code examples supported

## DOCUMENTATION:
- `https://docs.url`: Documentation links

## CONSTRAINTS:
- Technical constraints as bullet points

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
Free-form additional context
```

### Dynamic Team Composition
The system analyzes project content to suggest appropriate agents:
- Database keywords â†’ Database specialist
- Security/auth keywords â†’ Security expert
- UI/frontend keywords â†’ UX designer
- Always includes architect and developer

### Error Handling
- Line-specific error messages where possible
- Helpful suggestions for common issues
- Graceful degradation when resources unavailable

## What Remains (Phases 4-6)

### ðŸ“š Phase 4: Documentation Intelligence
- [ ] Implement documentation caching system
- [ ] Add version-aware documentation fetching
- [ ] Create fallback strategies for offline use
- [ ] Build suggestion engine for broken links

### ðŸ‘¥ Phase 5: Agent Consolidation
- [ ] Merge pm, po, sm agents into product-lead agent
- [ ] Update all references in commands
- [ ] Implement dynamic team formation logic
- [ ] Add team composition transparency

### ðŸ”§ Phase 6: Migration & Polish
- [ ] Create `baco migrate` command for existing users
- [ ] Build comprehensive error messages
- [ ] Add starter templates for common project types
- [ ] Complete documentation and examples

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Create a new baco.in file
/baco init

# 2. Edit the file with your requirements

# 3. Validate the syntax
/baco validate

# 4. Generate and review the plan
/baco plan

# 5. Execute the development
/baco execute
```

### Example Location
See `examples/baco.in.example` for a comprehensive example with:
- Multiple features with dependencies
- Various example formats
- Complete constraints section
- Detailed considerations

## Integration Status

The new baco.in workflow integrates with existing commands:
- âœ… `/help` - Updated with new commands
- ðŸ”„ `/generate-prp` - Ready for integration with baco.in data
- ðŸ”„ `/orchestrate` - Ready to use team composition from baco.in
- ðŸ”„ `/analyze` - Ready to consider constraints from baco.in

## Next Steps

1. Test the current implementation with real use cases
2. Implement Phase 4 (Documentation Intelligence) for enhanced context
3. Complete agent consolidation (Phase 5)
4. Add migration tools and polish (Phase 6)

## Important: Understanding BACO's Architecture

BACO is a **prompt-based system** that works entirely within Claude Code:

- **No executable code** - Everything is markdown instructions for Claude
- **No external dependencies** - Runs purely through Claude's interpretation
- **Integration through context** - Commands share information through Claude's understanding
- **User-friendly abstraction** - Appears as a working system while being transparent about its nature

The `.claude/` directory contains:
- **Command instructions** (`.claude/commands/`) - How Claude should respond to commands
- **Utility instructions** (`.claude/utils/`) - Guidelines for specific tasks like parsing
- **Schema reference** (`.claude/schemas/`) - Documentation of expected formats

This approach ensures BACO remains simple, portable, and cost-effective while providing powerful development assistance capabilities.
