# API Findings Summary

## APIs Tested

### 1. Yahoo Finance (yfinance)
- **Status**: ❌ Blocked - 429 Too Many Requests
- **Issue**: IP address appears to be banned
- **Attempted fixes**: Rate limiting, curl headers - all failed

### 2. Financial Modeling Prep (FMP)
- **Status**: ❌ Limited - Free tier US stocks only
- **Error**: "Free plan is limited to US stocks only"
- **API Key provided**: Yes, but limitation remained

### 3. EODHD
- **Status**: ❌ Limited - Demo only works for US stocks
- **French stocks**: Not available in free/demo tier

### 4. Alpha Vantage
- **Status**: ❌ Unclear European support
- **Documentation**: Focused on US markets

### 5. Polygon.io
- **Status**: ❌ US markets only
- **No European coverage**

### 6. Finnhub
- **Status**: ⚠️ Partially working
- **API Key**: cpb3bl9r01qniodcem60cpb3bl9r01qniodcem6g
- **Issues**:
  - Simple ticker mapping (removing .PA) causes incorrect company matching
  - Many French tickers map to US companies with similar symbols
  - Examples:
    - AC.PA → Associated Capital Group Inc (US) instead of Accor
    - SAN.PA → Banco Santander SA (Spain) instead of Sanofi
    - OR.PA → No data (should be L'Oreal)
  - Only TotalEnergies (TTE) correctly identified
- **Success rate**: 17/33 stocks returned data, but most are wrong companies
- **Features**: 
  - Real-time prices
  - Financial metrics
  - Currency conversion implemented (USD to EUR)

## Conclusion

None of the tested APIs provide reliable, comprehensive coverage for French stocks in their free tiers. The main issues are:

1. **Geographic limitations**: Most free APIs focus on US markets
2. **Ticker format issues**: French stocks use .PA suffix which doesn't map cleanly
3. **Data accuracy**: When data is available, it often maps to wrong companies

## Recommendations

1. **For production use**: Consider paid tiers of:
   - Bloomberg API
   - Refinitiv (Thomson Reuters)
   - Euronext official data feed
   
2. **For development/testing**: 
   - Use the few correctly mapped stocks (like TTE)
   - Implement a ticker mapping table for Finnhub
   - Consider web scraping as last resort (with proper rate limiting)

3. **Alternative approach**:
   - Use a different data source that specializes in European markets
   - Build a custom ticker mapping for Finnhub symbols
   - Cache data aggressively to minimize API calls
