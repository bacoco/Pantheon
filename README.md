# BACO - Basic Adaptive Context Orchestrator

A structured approach to defining software projects for AI-assisted development in Claude Code.

## What is BACO?

BACO provides a standardized format (`baco.md`) for describing software projects, enabling Claude Code to better understand your requirements and provide more accurate assistance. It acts as a bridge between your project vision and AI-generated implementation guidance.

## Key Benefits

- **Structured Requirements**: Define features, dependencies, and constraints in a consistent format
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain project context across multiple development sessions
- **Better AI Assistance**: Help Claude understand your coding conventions and architectural preferences
- **Reduced Ambiguity**: Clear specifications lead to more accurate code generation

## Getting Started

### 1. Install BACO

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bacoco/BACO.git
cd BACO
```

### 2. Create Your Project Definition

```
/baco init
```

This starts an interactive conversation where BACO helps you define your project:

**Example conversation:**
```
BACO: What type of application are you building?
You: A REST API with FastAPI

BACO: Great choice! Loading FastAPI best practices...
      What's the main purpose of your API?
You: Task management for teams

BACO: Perfect! Who are your target users?
You: Small businesses, 5-50 people per team

BACO: Let's explore features. What are the core features?
You: User auth, create/edit tasks, assign to team members

BACO: I'll organize these as:
      ✅ User Authentication (JWT-based)
      ✅ Task Management (CRUD operations)
      ✅ Team Collaboration
      
      Would you like me to suggest related features?
You: Yes

BACO: Based on task management apps, consider:
      - Real-time updates
      - Search and filters
      - Analytics dashboard
      - Notifications
      
[... continues gathering requirements ...]

BACO: Generating your customized baco.md file...
```

For a quick template instead, use: `/baco init --template`

```yaml
---
version: 1.0
project_type: "Web Application"
author: "Your Name"
---

## FEATURE: User Authentication
Secure login system with email/password...

## EXAMPLES:
- `./auth-example.js`: Our authentication pattern

## CONSTRAINTS:
- Must use PostgreSQL
- Response time < 200ms
```

### 3. Generate Development Plan

```
/baco plan
```

BACO analyzes your requirements and provides:
- Recommended architecture
- Implementation phases
- Technology suggestions
- Team composition (which specialist agents to consult)

### 4. Execute Implementation

```
/baco execute
```

Generates a comprehensive Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) to guide implementation.

## 🚀 New Features (Phases 4-5 Complete!)

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Workflows
BACO now orchestrates teams of specialized AI agents working together:

```
/workflow product-planning  # PM → PO → SM workflow
/workflow implementation   # Architect → Developer → QA workflow
/workflow ui-feature      # UX → Developer → QA workflow
```

**10 Specialized Agents** with domain expertise:
- **Winston** (Architect), **James** (Developer), **Elena** (QA)
- **Marcus** (Security), **John** (PM), **Sarah** (PO)
- **Bob** (SM), **Sally** (UX), **BMad Master** (Meta-orchestrator)
- **BACO Orchestrator** (Complexity analysis)

### 🎯 Git Integration
Seamless version control throughout development:
```
Options:
[ ] Initialize Git repository
[ ] Create feature branch  
[ ] Commit after each phase

Your choice (1-4) [include options like "1 git branch"]: 1 git branch
```

Features:
- Auto-initialize repositories
- Commit after each development phase
- Create feature branches
- Generate PR descriptions
- Smart gitignore templates

### 📱 Live Preview
Instant development server with mobile support:
```
🚀 Starting development server...
✅ Server running at http://localhost:3000

📱 Mobile Preview:

URLs for mobile devices:
• http://192.168.1.100:3000
```

### 🔧 Incremental Updates
Add features to existing projects safely:
```
/add-feature auth-jwt      # Add JWT authentication
/add-feature api-graphql   # Add GraphQL endpoint
/update-deps              # Smart dependency updates
```

Features:
- Analyze existing code before changes
- Automatic backups
- Intelligent code merging
- Conflict resolution
- Breaking change detection

## 🆕 Interactive Workflow with Code Generation

BACO now features a **fully interactive experience** that guides you seamlessly from project definition to **actual working code**:

### Complete Development Flow
```
/baco init → Interactive setup → Auto-plan → Auto-execute → Real code + Git + Preview
```

**BACO now generates actual code files with professional features:**
- Creates real project structures with tests
- Implements error handling automatically
- Manages dependencies intelligently
- Validates code and fixes errors
- Commits to Git at each phase
- Launches live preview when done
