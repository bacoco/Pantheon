3. **AI Team Assembles** ‚Üí Architect, Developer, QA, and UX specialists collaborate
4. **Watch It Build** ‚Üí Real-time progress as your app takes shape
5. **Preview & Iterate** ‚Üí Instant live preview with hot-reload

## üñ•Ô∏è Choose Your Interface

### CLI Mode (Production Ready)
For terminal enthusiasts and automation:

```bash
# Use directly in Claude Code
/baco init
```

## ‚ú® What Makes Pantheon Different?

- **AI Team Collaboration**: 15 specialized agents work together on your project

## üéØ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bacoco/BACO.git
cd BACO
```

### Start Your First Project

```
/baco init
```

This starts an interactive conversation where Pantheon helps you define your project:

**Example conversation:**
```
Pantheon: What type of application are you building?
You: A REST API with FastAPI

Pantheon: Great choice! Loading FastAPI best practices...
      What's the main purpose of your API?
You: Task management for teams

Pantheon: Perfect! Who are your target users?
You: Small businesses, 5-50 people per team

Pantheon: Let's explore features. What are the core features?
You: User auth, create/edit tasks, assign to team members

Pantheon: I'll organize these as:
      ‚úÖ User Authentication (JWT-based)
      ‚úÖ Task Management (CRUD operations)
      ‚úÖ Team Collaboration
      
      Would you like me to suggest related features?
You: Yes

Pantheon: Based on task management apps, consider:
      - Real-time updates
      - Search and filters
      - Analytics dashboard
      - Notifications
      
[... continues gathering requirements ...]

Pantheon: Generating your customized baco.md file...
```

For a quick template instead, use: `/baco init --template`

```yaml

## FEATURE: User Authentication
Secure login system with email/password...

## EXAMPLES:
- `./auth-example.js`: Our authentication pattern

## CONSTRAINTS:
- Must use PostgreSQL
- Response time < 200ms
```
