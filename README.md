# BACO - Beyond Automated Context Orchestrator

A structured approach to defining software projects for AI-assisted development in Claude Code.

## What is BACO?

BACO provides a standardized format (`baco.md`) for describing software projects, enabling Claude Code to better understand your requirements and provide more accurate assistance. It acts as a bridge between your project vision and AI-generated implementation guidance.

## Key Benefits

- **Structured Requirements**: Define features, dependencies, and constraints in a consistent format
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain project context across multiple development sessions
- **Better AI Assistance**: Help Claude understand your coding conventions and architectural preferences
- **Reduced Ambiguity**: Clear specifications lead to more accurate code generation

## Getting Started

### 1. Install BACO

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bacoco/BACO.git
cd BACO
```

### 2. Create Your Project Definition

```
/baco init
```

This starts an interactive conversation where BACO helps you define your project:

**Example conversation:**
```
BACO: What type of application are you building?
You: A REST API with FastAPI

BACO: Great choice! Loading FastAPI best practices...
      What's the main purpose of your API?
You: Task management for teams

BACO: Perfect! Who are your target users?
You: Small businesses, 5-50 people per team

BACO: Let's explore features. What are the core features?
You: User auth, create/edit tasks, assign to team members

BACO: I'll organize these as:
      ‚úÖ User Authentication (JWT-based)
      ‚úÖ Task Management (CRUD operations)
      ‚úÖ Team Collaboration
      
      Would you like me to suggest related features?
You: Yes

BACO: Based on task management apps, consider:
      - Real-time updates
      - Search and filters
      - Analytics dashboard
      - Notifications
      
[... continues gathering requirements ...]

BACO: Generating your customized baco.md file...
```

For a quick template instead, use: `/baco init --template`

```yaml
---
version: 1.0
project_type: "Web Application"
author: "Your Name"
---

## FEATURE: User Authentication
Secure login system with email/password...

## EXAMPLES:
- `./auth-example.js`: Our authentication pattern

## CONSTRAINTS:
- Must use PostgreSQL
- Response time < 200ms
```

### 3. Generate Development Plan

```
/baco plan
```

BACO analyzes your requirements and provides:
- Recommended architecture
- Implementation phases
- Technology suggestions
- Team composition (which specialist agents to consult)

### 4. Execute Implementation

```
/baco execute
```

Generates a comprehensive Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) to guide implementation.
