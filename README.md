## 🎯 Quick Start

### Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bacoco/BACO.git
cd BACO/baco-ui
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and start chatting!

### Option 2: Claude Code CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bacoco/BACO.git
cd BACO
```

### Start Your First Project

```
/baco init
```

This starts an interactive conversation where BACO helps you define your project:

**Example conversation:**
```
BACO: What type of application are you building?
You: A REST API with FastAPI

BACO: Great choice! Loading FastAPI best practices...
      What's the main purpose of your API?
You: Task management for teams

BACO: Perfect! Who are your target users?
You: Small businesses, 5-50 people per team

BACO: Let's explore features. What are the core features?
You: User auth, create/edit tasks, assign to team members

BACO: I'll organize these as:
      ✅ User Authentication (JWT-based)
      ✅ Task Management (CRUD operations)
      ✅ Team Collaboration
      
      Would you like me to suggest related features?
You: Yes

BACO: Based on task management apps, consider:
      - Real-time updates
      - Search and filters
      - Analytics dashboard
      - Notifications
      
[... continues gathering requirements ...]

BACO: Generating your customized baco.md file...
```

For a quick template instead, use: `/baco init --template`

```yaml
---
version: 1.0
project_type: "Web Application"

## FEATURE: User Authentication
Secure login system with email/password...

## EXAMPLES:
- `./auth-example.js`: Our authentication pattern

## CONSTRAINTS:
- Must use PostgreSQL
- Response time < 200ms
```
