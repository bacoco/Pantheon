## üöÄ From Idea to Implementation in Minutes

Imagine describing your app idea in plain English and watching as a pantheon of specialized AI gods brings it to life. Pantheon makes this possible by orchestrating Claude Code's capabilities through an intuitive interface.

### Your Development Journey:

1. **Describe Your Vision** ‚Üí `gods create "task management app"`
2. **Pantheon Understands** ‚Üí Analyzes complexity, suggests architecture, identifies requirements  
3. **AI Team Assembles** ‚Üí Architect, Developer, QA, and UX specialists collaborate
4. **Watch It Build** ‚Üí Real-time progress as your app takes shape
5. **Preview & Iterate** ‚Üí Instant live preview with hot-reload

### Quick Start - One Command Installation

```bash
# In Claude Code, run this single command:
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bacoco/Pantheon/main/install-pantheon.sh | bash

# Then start with collaborative divine council
/gods council
```

> **That's it!** No configuration needed. MCP tools are automatically enabled.

üìö **[See the complete User Guide ‚Üí](USER-GUIDE.md)**

## üñ•Ô∏è Choose Your Interface

### Web UI with Docker (New Pantheon UI!)
Full VS Code experience in your browser with integrated Claude:

[**Quick Start with Docker ‚Üí**](docs/docker/DOCKER-COMPLETE-GUIDE.md)

### CLI Mode (Direct Integration)
For terminal enthusiasts and Claude Code users:

```bash
# Start a collaborative planning session
/gods council

# The divine council will guide you through project planning
# with transparent collaboration between specialist gods
```

## üèõÔ∏è NEW: Collaborative Divine Council System

Pantheon now uses Anthropic's native sub-agent system for transparent, multi-perspective planning:

- **Natural Collaboration**: Gods work together in council sessions, building on each other's ideas
- **Transparent Process**: See when and why each specialist is summoned
- **Richer Solutions**: Multiple perspectives create comprehensive PRDs and PRPs
- **Chatroom Documentation**: All discussions preserved for reference

### Example Council Session
```
User: /gods council

Council: ‚ö° Welcome to the Divine Council of Olympus!
        Tell me about your project vision...

User: I need a real-time collaboration platform

Council: *Summoning Zeus to orchestrate*
        *Zeus invites Daedalus for architecture*
        *Apollo joins for UX design*
        
[Collaborative discussion creates comprehensive plan]
```

## ‚ú® What Makes Pantheon Different?

- **Web-Based IDE**: Full VS Code experience in your browser with Docker setup
- **Divine Council System**: Gods collaborate transparently to plan your project
- **AI Team Collaboration**: 15 specialized agents work together on your project
- **Smart Context Management**: Never lose track of requirements across sessions
- **UI Quality Scoring**: AI-driven design improvements with measurable results
- **Live Development**: See changes instantly with integrated preview server
- **Production-Ready Output**: Clean, tested, documented code following best practices

## üîß MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

Pantheon uses MCP tools to enhance the gods' capabilities:

- **Project-Local Configuration**: All MCP servers defined in `.mcp.json` - no global settings needed
- **Automatic Approval**: MCP servers are automatically enabled via `.claude/settings.json` - no manual approval required
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Gods use specialized tools like claude-flow for orchestration, playwright for testing, and browsermcp for UI design
- **First-Time Downloads**: MCP tools are downloaded automatically on first use (cached for future use)

## üéØ Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker with Web UI (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bacoco/Pantheon.git
cd Pantheon
./start-docker.sh
```

Then open **http://localhost:8080** and start building immediately:

```bash
# Start a collaborative divine council session
/gods council

# Or summon specific gods for help
/gods summon apollo      # UI/UX design
/gods summon daedalus    # System architecture
/gods summon hephaestus  # Implementation

# See all available gods
/gods list
```

**Note**: The terminal will show the Pantheon prompt: `‚ö° [coder@pantheon projects]$ `

**Note**: The `gods` command automatically integrates with Claude to provide the full Pantheon experience.

### Option 2: CLI in Claude Code (Recommended for Claude Users)

**One-command installation:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bacoco/Pantheon/main/install-pantheon.sh | bash

## üìù How Pantheon Works

Pantheon uses a collaborative divine council where specialist gods work together to understand and plan your project:

**Example Divine Council Session:**
```
User: /gods council

Council: ‚ö° Welcome to the Divine Council of Olympus!
         I am the voice of the Divine Council. Tell me about your project vision.

You: I need a task management API with FastAPI

Council: Excellent! A task management system requires expertise from several gods.
         
         *Summoning Zeus to orchestrate our session*
         
Zeus: I'll coordinate our planning. Let me invite Daedalus for the architecture.

         *Thunder rumbles as Daedalus arrives*

Daedalus: For a FastAPI task management system, I recommend:
          - RESTful API with clear resource boundaries
          - PostgreSQL for reliable data storage
          - JWT authentication for security
          
Zeus: Let me also summon Apollo for the API design...

Apollo: I'll ensure the API is intuitive. Key endpoints:
        - POST /tasks - Create with clear validation
        - GET /tasks - Filterable, paginated lists
        - PUT /tasks/{id} - Full updates
        - DELETE /tasks/{id} - Soft deletes

[Gods continue collaborating, building comprehensive plan]

Council: Based on our divine wisdom, I'm now creating your PRD and PRP...
```

The council creates comprehensive documentation in `/chatrooms/` including your PRD and implementation blueprint.

```yaml
---
version: 1.0
project_type: "Web Application"
author: "Your Name"
---

## FEATURE: User Authentication
Secure login system with email/password...

## EXAMPLES:
- `./auth-example.js`: Our authentication pattern

## CONSTRAINTS:
- Must use PostgreSQL
- Response time < 200ms
```

## üÜï What's New: Collaborative Divine Council

Pantheon now features a revolutionary collaborative planning system using Anthropic's native sub-agent technology:

- **Transparent Collaboration**: Watch as gods discuss and build on each other's ideas
- **Natural Conversations**: No complex command sequences - just describe your vision
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: All council discussions saved in `/chatrooms/`
- **Multi-Perspective Solutions**: Each god contributes their specialized expertise
