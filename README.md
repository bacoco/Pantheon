# 🏛️ Enhanced Pantheon Multi-AI System

**Divine AI Orchestration with Project Memory & Quality Gates - NO API KEYS NEEDED!**

## ✨ What's New in Enhanced Pantheon
- 🧠 **Project Memory**: Zeus remembers your project between sessions
- ⚖️ **Quality Reviews**: Oracle reviews work before moving to next step
- 💰 **60% Cost Savings**: Smart model routing (Claude for creation, FREE Gemini for validation)
- 📋 **Structured Workflow**: Requirements → Design → Code (no more chaos!)

## 🚀 Quick Start

Just type these in Claude Code:

```
"Zeus, help me build a web app"
"Divine council, create a complete application"
"Hermes, what tools can I use?"
"Athena, design a database architecture"
"Apollo, review my code"
```

**That's it. No setup. No API keys. Just talk to the gods.**

## 🔄 Enhanced Workflow

1. **Requirements Phase**
   - Zeus asks about your vision
   - Creates `.pantheon/vision.md`
   - Oracle reviews → Must approve

2. **Design Phase**  
   - Athena designs architecture
   - Creates `.pantheon/architecture.md`
   - Oracle reviews → Must approve

3. **Implementation Phase**
   - Hephaestus builds according to design
   - Oracle validates before deployment
   - All decisions saved in Sacred Scrolls

## 📜 Sacred Scrolls (Project Memory)

When you start a project, Pantheon creates `.pantheon/` folder with:

```
your-project/
└── .pantheon/          # Sacred Scrolls - Project Memory
    ├── vision.md       # What you're building and why
    ├── architecture.md # Technical decisions made
    ├── standards.md    # Code style rules
    └── progress.md     # What's been done
```

**Zeus remembers everything between sessions!**

## 🎯 Example Conversations

### Building Something
```
You: "Divine council, help me build a todo app"
Council: "Welcome! Let me gather the gods..."
[Interactive dialogue begins]
```

### Tool Discovery
```
You: "Hermes, what tools can Zeus use?"
Hermes: "Lord Zeus can use: Task (summon gods), TodoWrite (track tasks), Read/Write (files), Bash (commands)..."
```

### Code Review
```
You: "Apollo, review this function"
Apollo: "Let me examine the code for quality issues..."
```
