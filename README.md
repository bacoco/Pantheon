[![Quality](https://img.shields.io/badge/quality-10%2F10-gold)](.claude/docs)
[![CI/CD](https://img.shields.io/badge/CI%2FCD-automated-blue)](./claude/scripts)

## 🚀 Quick Start

Just type these in Claude Code - works immediately with no setup:

```
"Zeus, help me build a web app"
"Divine council, create a complete application" 
"Athena, design a database architecture"
"Apollo, review my code"
```

**No API keys. No external dependencies. Pure Claude Code.**

## 🎯 BMAD-METHOD Integration

Pantheon now features complete BMAD methodology:

- **Two-Phase Workflow**: Phase 1 (Planning) → Phase 2 (Execution)
- **Sacred Scrolls**: XML-based context preservation system
- **Quality Gates**: Oracle enforces standards at every checkpoint
- **Auto-Testing**: 77 comprehensive tests with 100% pass rate
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing, validation, and deployment

## 🏛️ The Gods (Claude Code Sub-Agents)

Each god is a specialized Claude Code sub-agent via the Task tool:

| God | Purpose | Say This |

## ⚡ Optional: MCP-Enhanced Powers

Install MCP servers for 10x enhanced capabilities:

```bash
# Install MCP tools (optional)
./install-divine-tools.sh

# Then restart Claude Code
```

### MCP Enhanced Gods Get:
- **Zeus**: task-master for complex orchestration
- **Athena**: serena for deep code analysis  
- **Hephaestus**: shadcn-ui for instant UI creation
- **Hermes**: web-search for research
- **All Gods**: basic-memory for persistence

## 🔄 Quality-Gated Workflow

Pantheon enforces quality through Oracle checkpoints:

1. **Requirements** → Oracle Review → **Design** 
2. **Design** → Oracle Review → **Implementation**
3. **Implementation** → Oracle Review → **Deploy**

## 📜 Sacred Scrolls (Project Memory)

Projects persist state in `.pantheon/` folders:

```
your-project/
└── .pantheon/          # Sacred Scrolls
    ├── vision.md       # What you're building
    ├── architecture.md # Technical decisions
    ├── standards.md    # Code style rules
    └── progress.md     # Development history
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Task Tool Orchestration
```javascript
// Behind the scenes
Task("zeus", "Create project plan for todo app");
Task("athena", "Design architecture based on Zeus's plan");
Task("oracle", "Review Athena's architecture for quality");
Task("hephaestus", "Implement based on approved design");
```

### Natural Language Interface
- **Direct**: "Zeus, help me build X"
- **Command**: "/gods plan" → structured workflow
- **Council**: "Divine council, assemble" → full orchestration

## 📁 Project Structure

```
pantheon-multi-ai/
├── README.md              # This file
├── CLAUDE.md              # Claude Code configuration
├── install-divine-tools.sh # Optional MCP enhancement
└── .claude/

        └── ... (all gods)
```

## 🎯 Example Usage

### Build Something
```
You: "Divine council, help me build a todo app"
Council: "Let me gather the gods and create a plan..."
[Creates project structure and coordinates development]
```

### Review Code
```  
You: "Apollo, review this function for quality"
Apollo: [Analyzes code and provides detailed feedback]
```

### Quality Gate
```
You: "Oracle, are we ready to deploy?"
Oracle: [Reviews all artifacts and gives approval/blocking issues]
```

## 🚀 CI/CD Automation

### Automated Workflows
Pantheon includes complete CI/CD automation:

```bash
# Run full CI pipeline
.claude/scripts/pantheon-ci.sh

# Create releases
.claude/scripts/release.sh minor
```

### Claude Code Hooks
Auto-testing and auto-commit via `.claude/hooks.json`:
- **PostToolUse**: Runs tests after file changes
- **Stop**: Auto-commits when tests pass  
- **PreToolUse**: Protects Sacred Scrolls
- **SubagentStop**: Tracks god completion

### Interactive Requirements
Gods chat with users to gather:
- App name and description
- UI reference URLs for analysis
- CSS frameworks and preferences
- Image assets and resources
- Technical stack decisions
- Deployment targets

- Automatic git repository creation
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Test framework configuration
- Documentation generation
- Deployment automation
