# BACO LLM-Driven Architecture

## Overview

BACO has been transformed from a keyword-based system to a fully LLM-driven orchestration platform that implements the vision of recursive AI architecture - where LLMs orchestrate LLMs.

## Key Innovations

### 1. Meta-Orchestration with LLM Reasoning

Instead of rigid rules, BACO uses LLM reasoning for all orchestration decisions:

```python
# Old approach (keyword-based)
if "microservices" in task.lower():
    agents.append("architect")

# New approach (LLM reasoning)
complexity = await analyzer.analyze_with_reasoning(
    task=task,
    project_context=context,
    tech_stack=stack
)
# Returns nuanced multi-dimensional analysis
```

### 2. Rich Agent Personas

Each agent has a deep persona inspired by BMAD patterns:

- **Winston (Architect)**: Holistic system designer who bridges all layers
- **James (Developer)**: Pragmatic engineer focused on clean code
- **Elena (QA)**: User-centric quality guardian
- **Marcus (Security)**: Defense-in-depth security expert

### 3. Self-Improving Pattern Memory

BACO learns from successful implementations:

```python
# After successful task completion
pattern_id = await orchestrator.learn_from_last_task(
    success=True,
    metrics={"quality": 0.95, "time": "2 days"}
)
```

Patterns are evaluated by LLM for generalizability and stored for future use.

### 4. Intelligent Context Compression

When conversations get long, BACO intelligently compresses context:

```python
# Automatic compression when approaching token limits
compressed = await context_manager.compress_context_if_needed(
    current_task="Building API endpoints"
)
# Preserves essential information while reducing tokens by 70%
```

### 5. PRP Generation

Generates comprehensive Product Requirements Prompts following Context Engineering patterns:

```python
prp = await orchestrator.generate_prp(
    task="Build real-time chat system",
    tech_stack=["Python", "WebSockets", "Redis"]
)
# Produces complete implementation guide with validation loops
```

## Architecture Components

### Prompts Module (`baco/prompts/`)
- **orchestrator.py**: Meta-reasoning prompts for orchestration decisions
- **agents.py**: Rich persona prompts for each specialist agent

### Complexity Analyzer (`baco/complexity.py`)

- Confidence scoring and human review triggers
- Structured output with Pydantic models

### Orchestrator (`baco/orchestrator.py`)
- LLM-driven agent selection
- Pattern memory integration
- Context compression management
- PRP generation capabilities

### Memory System (`baco/memory/`)
- Self-curating pattern storage
- LLM evaluation of pattern effectiveness
- Similarity matching for relevant patterns

### Context Management (`baco/context/`)
- Intelligent compression using LLM summarization
- Progressive context building
- Pattern extraction during compression

### Generators (`baco/generators/`)
- PRP generation following Context Engineering
- Structured task breakdowns
- Validation loops and anti-patterns

## Example Usage

```python
from baco.config import BACOConfig
from baco.orchestrator import BACOOrchestrator

# Initialize with rich configuration
config = BACOConfig(
    openai_api_key="your-key",
    model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
    agents=[
        AgentConfig(name="architect", enabled=True),
        AgentConfig(name="developer", enabled=True),
        AgentConfig(name="qa", enabled=True),
        AgentConfig(name="security", enabled=True),
    ]
)

orchestrator = BACOOrchestrator(config)

# Process complex task
result = await orchestrator.process_task(
    task="Design microservices architecture for e-commerce",
    tech_stack=["Python", "Kubernetes", "PostgreSQL"],
    requirements=["100k users", "PCI compliance", "Multi-region"]
)

# Generate implementation guide
prp = await orchestrator.generate_prp(
    task="Build authentication service",
    result=result
)

# Learn from success
await orchestrator.learn_from_last_task(success=True)
```

## Benefits of LLM-Driven Architecture

1. **Natural Understanding**: Decisions based on semantic understanding, not keywords
2. **Continuous Learning**: System improves through pattern recognition
3. **Flexibility**: New scenarios don't require code changes
4. **Confidence Awareness**: System knows when to request human review
5. **Context Preservation**: Intelligent compression maintains continuity

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-Modal Context**: Incorporate diagrams and mockups
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Adjust agents mid-task based on discoveries
- **Cross-Project Learning**: Federated learning across BACO instances
- **Predictive Planning**: Estimate timelines from requirements

## Testing

Run the test script to see all features in action:

```bash
python test_baco.py
```

This will demonstrate:
- LLM complexity analysis
- Dynamic agent selection
- Pattern learning
- Context compression
- PRP generation
