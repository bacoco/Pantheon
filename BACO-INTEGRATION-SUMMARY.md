### üîó Integration with Existing Systems

The BACO concepts seamlessly integrate with our enhanced Pantheon system:

1. **Preserved Core Principles**:
   - Gemini models remain read-only validators
   - Claude models remain primary creators
   - Cost optimization still active
   - Circuit breakers and resilience patterns intact

2. **Enhanced Capabilities**:
   - Divine council adds collaborative layer
   - Slash commands simplify interaction
   - Transparent reasoning improves trust
   - Mythological metaphors aid understanding

3. **Synergies**:
   - Event system broadcasts council events
   - Workflow orchestrator uses god agents
   - Validation pipeline integrates with councils
   - Cost optimizer considers god invocations

### üìä Current Status

**Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ Complete**
- Divine Council orchestrator
- Council session management
- God agent base structure
- Zeus orchestrator implementation
- Slash command processor

**Phase 2: God Agents üöß In Progress**
- Need to implement remaining gods (Athena, Apollo, Hephaestus, Hermes, Prometheus, Artemis)
- Integrate with Claude/Gemini infrastructure

**Phase 3-5: üìÖ Planned**
- Transparent reasoning visualization
- Artifact handoff mechanisms
- PRD/PRP generation
- Collaboration visualizer
- Testing and documentation

### üí° Usage Examples

```javascript
// Start a divine council session
const processor = new SlashCommandProcessor();
await processor.processCommand('/pantheon council "Design authentication system"');

// Summon specific god
await processor.processCommand('/pantheon summon athena');

// Get project orchestration from Zeus
await processor.processCommand('/orchestrate "Build e-commerce platform"');

// Generate PRD
await processor.processCommand('/generate-prd "Mobile Banking App"');

// Consult the oracle
await processor.processCommand('/gods oracle "What architecture should we use?"');
```

### üéØ Benefits Achieved

1. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Multiple AI personas working together transparently
2. **Intuitive Interface**: Slash commands make complex operations simple
3. **Engaging Experience**: Mythological metaphors create memorable interactions
