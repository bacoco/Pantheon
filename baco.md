# BACO Command Executor

This file demonstrates how to use BACO commands in Claude Code.

## Usage

Simply type any of the following commands in Claude:

### Analyze Task Complexity
```
/analyze Build a real-time notification system with WebSocket support
```

### Orchestrate Multi-Agent Analysis
```
/orchestrate Design a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform
```

### Generate Implementation Guide (PRP)
```
/generate-prp Create a REST API for user authentication with JWT
```

### Learn from Successful Patterns
```
/learn-pattern "Implemented caching layer with Redis" "Reduced response time by 80%"
```

### Get Help
```
/help
```

## How It Works

1. When you type a command, Claude reads the corresponding file in `.claude/commands/`
2. For orchestration, Claude embodies the agent personas in `.claude/agents/`
3. Patterns are stored in `.claude/memory/patterns.json`
4. All processing happens within Claude - no external APIs needed

## Quick Start Example

Try this sequence:

1. First, analyze a task:
   ```
   /analyze Build a chat application with real-time messaging
   ```

2. Based on complexity, orchestrate agents:
   ```
   /orchestrate Build a chat application with real-time messaging
   ```

3. Generate implementation guide:
   ```
   /generate-prp Build a chat application with real-time messaging
   ```

## Benefits

- **No API Costs**: Everything runs in Claude Code
- **Transparent**: See all reasoning and analysis
- **Customizable**: Modify prompts and agents as needed
- **Learning**: System improves through pattern recognition
- **Comprehensive**: From analysis to implementation guide

## Extending BACO

To add new commands:
1. Create a new file in `.claude/commands/`
2. Follow the existing command structure
3. Document the command in `/help`

To add new agents:
1. Create a new file in `.claude/agents/`
2. Define the persona and expertise
3. Update orchestration logic to include the agent

## Tips

- Be specific in your task descriptions
- Use orchestration for complex, multi-faceted tasks
- Record successful patterns to build knowledge
- Review existing patterns before starting new tasks
