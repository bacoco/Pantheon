- Resource organization

## File Structure Changes

```
.claude/
├── agents/          # All specialist agents
├── commands/        # Slash commands
├── teams/          # Team configurations (NEW)
├── workflows/       # Multi-agent workflows
├── tasks/          # Executable tasks
├── templates/      # Document templates
├── knowledge/      # Knowledge base (NEW)
├── data/           # Reference data
└── memory/         # Pattern storage
```

## Integration Benefits

1. **Maintained Simplicity**: Core BACO commands unchanged
2. **Added Power**: Advanced features available when needed
3. **Flexible Activation**: Use simple commands or full orchestration
4. **Knowledge-Driven**: Agents backed by comprehensive knowledge base
5. **Team Collaboration**: Pre-configured teams for common scenarios
6. **State Management**: Complex workflows can pause and resume
7. **Context Preservation**: All Context Engineering principles maintained

## Usage Examples

### Simple Usage (unchanged)
```
/analyze Build a REST API
/generate-prp User authentication system
```

### Advanced Usage (new capabilities)
```
/team product-team
/agent ux
*research-plan "Mobile app redesign"
/workflow security-review
```

## Migration Notes

1. All existing BACO commands work as before
2. New features are additive, not breaking
3. BMAD-METHOD directory can now be removed
4. Context Engineering functionality fully preserved
5. Examples directory integrated and expanded

## Next Steps

The remaining low-priority task is:
- Create expansion pack architecture for domain extensions

This would allow easy addition of domain-specific knowledge and patterns (e.g., healthcare, finance, gaming) as modular extensions.

## Conclusion

BACO now combines:
- Its original simplicity and ease of use
- BMAD's powerful agent and workflow capabilities
- Context Engineering's validation and quality focus
- A comprehensive knowledge base system

The integration preserves the best of all three systems while creating a more powerful, unified orchestration platform for Claude Code.
