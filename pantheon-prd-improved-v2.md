## THE PROBLEM (Why We're Doing This)

**Current Pantheon:** Users say "Zeus, build a web app" and get conversational help, but:
- No memory between sessions (Zeus forgets your project)
- No structured workflow (just ad-hoc responses)
- No quality gates (no review before moving forward)
- No cost optimization (wastes API calls)
- No persistent project context

**After Enhancement:** Same natural language, but now:
- Zeus remembers your project across sessions
- Follows structured: Requirements → Design → Code workflow
- Oracle reviews each step before continuing
- Smart routing saves 60% on API costs
- All project info saved in files

---

## WHAT WE'RE BUILDING (Plain English)

### 1. **Project Memory System** (Called "Sacred Scrolls")
**What it is**: Files that remember your project details across sessions
**Where**: `.pantheon/` folder in each project
**Why needed**: So Zeus doesn't forget your requirements when you come back tomorrow

**Example Structure**:
```
my-project/
└── .pantheon/
    ├── vision.md          # What you're building and why
    ├── architecture.md    # Technical decisions made
    ├── standards.md       # Code style rules
    └── progress.md        # What's been done
```

### 2. **Quality Review System** (Called "Oracle")
**What it is**: AI agent that reviews work before moving to next step
**Why needed**: Prevents rushing from idea to code without proper planning
**How it works**: 
- Requirements written → Oracle reviews → If approved, move to Design
- Design created → Oracle reviews → If approved, move to Coding
- Forces structured thinking instead of chaos

### 3. **Structured Workflow** (Called "Sacred Trinity")
**What it is**: Fixed sequence: Requirements → Design → Code
**Why needed**: Professional software development follows process, not random coding
**Current problem**: Pantheon jumps straight to coding without planning

### 4. **Cost Optimization** (Model Routing)
**What it is**: Use free Gemini models for review, expensive Claude for creation
**Why needed**: Current system wastes money using Claude for everything
**Savings**: 60% reduction in API costs

{{REASONING}}

## Key Components:
1. {{COMPONENT_1}} - {{PURPOSE_1}}
2. {{COMPONENT_2}} - {{PURPOSE_2}}
```

4. Update `.claude/agents/divine-council.md` - Add this section:
```markdown
## Project Memory Creation
When starting new project:
1. Create `.pantheon/` folder in project directory
2. Copy templates from `.claude/templates/project-memory/`
3. Fill in {{PLACEHOLDERS}} with user's actual requirements
4. Save files for future reference
```

**DONE CRITERIA**: 
- New projects create `.pantheon/` folder automatically
- Templates are filled with actual project info
- Information persists when user returns to project

### TASK 2: Add Review System (10 hours)

**GOAL**: Add quality review before moving between workflow steps

**WHAT TO DO**:
1. Create file: `.claude/agents/oracle.md`
```markdown
# Oracle - Quality Review Agent

4. If approved, allow progression to next phase
```

2. Update `.claude/agents/divine-council.md` - Add review steps:
```markdown
## Enhanced Workflow with Reviews
1. User requests project → Create requirements
2. Oracle reviews requirements → Must approve before design
3. Create design based on approved requirements  
4. Oracle reviews design → Must approve before coding
5. Break design into coding tasks
6. Oracle reviews tasks → Must approve before implementation
```

**DONE CRITERIA**:
- Oracle agent exists and can review work
- Divine Council asks Oracle for approval between phases
- Progression blocked until Oracle approves

### TASK 3: Add Cost Optimization (6 hours)

**GOAL**: Use cheaper models for review tasks, expensive models for creation

**WHAT TO DO**:
1. Create file: `.claude/configs/model-routing.json`
```json
{
  "routing_rules": {
    "creation_tasks": {
      "model": "claude-3-sonnet",
      "agents": ["divine-council", "zeus", "athena", "hephaestus"]
    },
    "review_tasks": {
      "model": "gemini-1.5-pro",
      "agents": ["oracle", "apollo", "themis"]
    },
    "support_tasks": {
      "model": "gemini-1.5-flash", 
      "agents": ["hermes", "calliope"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. Update `.claude/settings.json` - Add routing config:
```json
{
  "model_routing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "config_file": "configs/model-routing.json",
    "cost_tracking": true
  }
}
```

**DONE CRITERIA**:
- Creation tasks use Claude (expensive, high quality)
- Review tasks use Gemini (free/cheap)
- Support tasks use Gemini Flash (fastest/cheapest)

### TASK 4: Upgrade Zeus Agent (12 hours)

**GOAL**: Make Zeus coordinate the new structured workflow

**WHAT TO DO**:
1. Open `.claude/agents/zeus.md`
2. Replace entire content with:

```markdown
# Zeus - Project Coordinator

## New Responsibilities  
Coordinate structured development workflow instead of ad-hoc responses.

## When user says: "Zeus, build [PROJECT]"
1. Check if `.pantheon/` folder exists
   - If yes: Load existing project memory
   - If no: Create new project memory

2. Start Requirements Phase:
   - Ask user about project vision
   - Fill in vision.md template
   - Ask Oracle to review requirements
   - If Oracle rejects: Fix issues and re-submit
   - If Oracle approves: Move to Design Phase

3. Design Phase:
   - Based on approved requirements, create architecture
   - Fill in architecture.md template  
   - Ask Oracle to review design
   - If Oracle rejects: Fix issues and re-submit
   - If Oracle approves: Move to Coding Phase

4. Coding Phase:
   - Break design into specific coding tasks
   - Create task list with requirements traceability
   - Ask Oracle to review task breakdown
   - If approved: Begin implementation

## Project Memory Integration
- Always read vision.md before starting work
- Always read architecture.md to understand technical decisions
- Always update progress.md when completing work
- Store all decisions in appropriate memory files

## Example Response Format
"I see you want to build [PROJECT]. Let me check your project memory...

[If new project]
I'll start by understanding your vision. Tell me:
1. Who will use this application?
2. What problem does it solve?
3. Any technical requirements or constraints?

[If existing project]  
I see we're working on [PROJECT] with [SUMMARY FROM MEMORY]. 
Current status: [PHASE]. What would you like to work on?"
```

**DONE CRITERIA**:
- Zeus follows structured workflow instead of ad-hoc responses
- Zeus reads and updates project memory files
- Zeus coordinates with Oracle for approvals

### TASK 5: Create Requirements Template (4 hours)

**GOAL**: Standardize how requirements are written

**WHAT TO DO**:
1. Create file: `.claude/templates/requirements-template.md`
```markdown
# Requirements: {{FEATURE_NAME}}

## User Story
As a {{USER_TYPE}}, I want {{CAPABILITY}} so that {{BENEFIT}}.

## Acceptance Criteria
WHEN {{TRIGGER_EVENT}} THEN {{EXPECTED_BEHAVIOR}}
WHEN {{TRIGGER_EVENT}} THEN {{EXPECTED_BEHAVIOR}}

IF {{CONDITION}} THEN {{EXPECTED_BEHAVIOR}}
IF {{CONDITION}} THEN {{EXPECTED_BEHAVIOR}}

## Edge Cases
- What happens if {{EDGE_CASE_1}}?
- What happens if {{EDGE_CASE_2}}?

## Technical Requirements
- Performance: {{PERFORMANCE_REQUIREMENT}}
- Security: {{SECURITY_REQUIREMENT}}  
- Integration: {{INTEGRATION_REQUIREMENT}}

## Definition of Done
- [ ] {{COMPLETION_CRITERIA_1}}
- [ ] {{COMPLETION_CRITERIA_2}}
- [ ] {{COMPLETION_CRITERIA_3}}
```

2. Update agents to use template when creating requirements

**DONE CRITERIA**:
- All requirements follow same format
- Easy to review and understand
- Clear acceptance criteria for testing

### TASK 6: Testing & Documentation (8 hours)

**GOAL**: Make sure everything works and is documented

**WHAT TO DO**:
1. Test complete workflow:
```
User: "Divine council, build a task management app"
Expected: 
- Creates .pantheon/ folder
- Asks structured questions about vision
- Creates vision.md file
- Asks Oracle to review
- Oracle provides specific feedback
- Moves to design phase after approval
```

2. Create simple README update:
```markdown
# Enhanced Pantheon - Now with Project Memory

## What's New
- Zeus remembers your project between sessions
- Quality reviews before moving to next step  
- 60% lower costs through smart model routing
