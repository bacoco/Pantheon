# MCP Removal Summary

## Removed MCP Servers
- ✅ **claude-flow** - Removed from .mcp.json
- ✅ **ruv-swarm** - Was not present (already removed)

## Cleaned God Configurations
Removed all `mcp__claude-flow__*` tools from:
- aegis.md
- apollo.md
- daedalus.md
- divine-council.md
- hephaestus.md
- themis.md
- zeus.md

## Remaining MCP Servers
- **playwright** - For UI testing and screenshots
- **context7** - For code context retrieval
- **task-master-ai** - For task orchestration
- **shadcn-ui** - For UI components

## Core Tools Remaining
Divine Council and Zeus now have essential tools:
- `task` - Summon other gods
- `bash` - Run shell commands (git, directories)
- `read_file/write_file` - File operations
- `todo_write` - Task tracking
- `web_search` - Research capabilities

The system is now cleaner and should work properly without the removed MCP servers.
