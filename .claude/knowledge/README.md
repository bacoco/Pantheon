## How to Use

### For Agents
Agents can reference knowledge base entries using:
```yaml
dependencies:
  - type: knowledge
    path: domains/web/react-patterns.md
```

### For Commands
Commands can load knowledge contextually:
```markdown
Load knowledge from: knowledge/patterns/security/authentication.md
Apply pattern to current task...
```

### For Users
Users can browse the knowledge base to understand available patterns and best practices.

## Contributing

When adding new knowledge:
1. Place in appropriate category
2. Use clear, descriptive filenames
3. Include metadata header
4. Provide examples
5. Link related content

## Metadata Format

Each knowledge file should start with:
```yaml
---
title: Knowledge Entry Title
category: Category Name
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
confidence: high|medium|low
---
```
