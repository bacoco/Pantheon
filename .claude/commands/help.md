### 🎭 `/orchestrate <task>`
Coordinate multiple specialist agents to provide comprehensive insights.

**Usage**: `/orchestrate Design a payment processing microservice`

**Output**: Perspectives from relevant agents (Architect, Developer, QA, Security) synthesized into actionable recommendations.

### 📝 `/generate-prp <task>`
Generate a complete Product Requirements Prompt for implementation.

**Usage**: `/generate-prp Create user authentication with JWT`

**Output**: Comprehensive implementation guide with context, tasks, validation strategy, and success criteria.

### 🧠 `/learn-pattern <task> <outcome>`
Evaluate and store successful implementation patterns for future use.

**Usage**: `/learn-pattern "WebSocket chat implementation" "Success: 50ms latency, 10k users"`

**Output**: Pattern evaluation and storage decision with applicability conditions.

### ❓ `/help`
Display this help message with command descriptions and usage examples.

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Start with Analysis**: Always begin by analyzing task complexity
   ```
   /analyze Create a REST API for inventory management
   ```

2. **Get Expert Insights**: For complex tasks, orchestrate multiple agents
   ```
   /orchestrate Build a distributed event processing system
   ```

3. **Generate Implementation Guide**: Create detailed PRPs for development
   ```
   /generate-prp Implement OAuth2 authentication flow
   ```

4. **Learn from Success**: Record patterns from successful implementations
   ```
   /learn-pattern "Microservice deployment" "Achieved 99.9% uptime"
   ```

## Specialist Agents

When using `/orchestrate`, these specialists may be activated:

- **🏗️ Winston (Architect)**: System design, scalability, technology selection
- **💻 James (Developer)**: Implementation approach, code quality, best practices
- **✅ Elena (QA)**: Testing strategy, user experience, quality assurance
- **🔒 Marcus (Security)**: Threat modeling, security controls, compliance

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Be Specific**: The more context you provide, the better the analysis
2. **Iterate**: Use analysis results to refine your orchestration requests
3. **Learn Continuously**: Record successful patterns to build institutional knowledge
4. **Combine Commands**: Use analysis → orchestration → PRP generation for complex projects
