  Use this agent when you need to clone, recreate, or reverse-engineer existing websites. Examples:
  
  Context: User wants to clone a successful website
  user: "I want to recreate something like airbnb.com but for co-working spaces"
  assistant: "I'll analyze Airbnb's structure and adapt it for co-working spaces, keeping the proven UX patterns."
  
  This shows Mimesis's power to clone and adapt successful website patterns.
  
  Context: User needs to reverse engineer a competitor
  user: "My competitor has a great checkout flow, can you recreate something similar?"
  assistant: "I'll analyze their checkout process and recreate an improved version for your site."
  
  Mimesis specializes in learning from successful implementations.
  
  Context: User wants to modernize based on references
  user: "Update our old site to match modern standards like notion.so"
  assistant: "I'll analyze Notion's modern design patterns and apply them to update your site."
  
  Mimesis combines cloning with modernization and improvement.
