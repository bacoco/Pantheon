# MCP Tool Integration Test - Divine Council Session

This document demonstrates the integration of MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools into the Pantheon divine council system.

## Test Scenario: Real-Time Collaboration Platform

### Council Initialization

**Council**: Let me initialize our divine council session for your real-time collaboration platform...

[Using mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init with topology="hierarchical" for structured collaboration]

**Council**: I've initialized our divine swarm. Let me check which gods are available...

[Using mcp__claude-flow__agent_list to see all available specialists]

### Summoning Gods with MCP Tools

**Council**: Based on your needs, I'll orchestrate a multi-god collaboration...

[Using mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate with strategy="parallel" for concurrent planning]

## Zeus - Orchestration

**Zeus**: As king of gods, let me coordinate our efforts...

[Using mcp__claude-flow__swarm_status to monitor overall progress]
[Using mcp__claude-flow__workflow_create to structure our planning phases]

## Daedalus - Architecture Analysis

**Daedalus**: Let me analyze potential architectural patterns...

[Using mcp__claude-flow__github_repo_analyze to study similar systems]
[Using mcp__claude-flow__bottleneck_analyze to identify potential issues]
[Using mcp__claude-flow__performance_report to establish baselines]

## Apollo - UX Enhancement

**Apollo**: I'll research modern collaboration UI patterns...

[Using browsermcp to explore design trends]
[Using mcp__claude-flow__ui_score to assess current designs]
[Using mcp__claude-flow__design_system to create cohesive patterns]
[Using mcp__claude-flow__ui_improve for enhancement suggestions]

## Hephaestus - Implementation Planning

**Hephaestus**: Let me prepare the development approach...

[Using mcp__claude-flow__sparc_mode with mode="tdd" for test-driven development]
[Using mcp__claude-flow__terminal_execute for build commands]
[Using mcp__claude-flow__github_pr_manage for code review workflow]
[Using mcp__claude-flow__code_improve for optimization]

## Themis - Quality Strategy

**Themis**: I'll establish our quality assurance approach...

[Using playwright for E2E test framework setup]
[Using mcp__claude-flow__quality_assess for quality metrics]
[Using mcp__claude-flow__error_analysis for error pattern detection]
[Using mcp__claude-flow__benchmark_run for performance baselines]

## Aegis - Security Architecture

**Aegis**: Let me ensure divine protection for this system...

[Using mcp__claude-flow__security_scan for vulnerability assessment]
[Using mcp__claude-flow__daa_fault_tolerance for resilience]
[Using mcp__claude-flow__backup_create for disaster recovery]
[Using mcp__claude-flow__log_analysis for security monitoring]

## Council Synthesis

**Council**: Synchronizing all divine insights...

[Using mcp__claude-flow__coordination_sync to align all gods]

### Final Outputs

The council has successfully demonstrated:

1. **Swarm Initialization**: Created hierarchical collaboration structure
2. **Multi-God Orchestration**: Parallel task execution across specialists
3. **Architecture Analysis**: Used MCP tools for codebase and performance insights
4. **UX Research**: Leveraged design tools for modern patterns
5. **Development Planning**: Integrated SPARC modes and Git workflows
6. **Quality Assurance**: Established comprehensive testing with Playwright
7. **Security Hardening**: Applied multiple security analysis tools
8. **Coordination**: Synchronized all perspectives into unified plan

## MCP Tool Benefits

- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Each god now has specialized MCP tools
- **Better Integration**: Tools work seamlessly with existing workflows
- **Richer Insights**: Deeper analysis through specialized tooling
- **Automated Workflows**: MCP tools enable automation of complex tasks
- **Real Monitoring**: Live status tracking of divine collaborations

## Next Steps

1. Use `/gods council` to start a real project planning session
2. Watch as gods leverage their MCP tools naturally
3. Review generated PRD/PRP for comprehensive coverage
4. Execute implementation with MCP-enhanced workflows

*The divine council is now empowered with the full might of MCP tools!*
