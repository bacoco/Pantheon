# Elicitation Methods Data

## Core Reflective Methods

### Expand or Contract for Audience
- Ask whether to 'expand' (add detail, elaborate) or 'contract' (simplify, clarify)
- Identify specific target audience if relevant
- Tailor content complexity and depth accordingly
- Balance completeness with clarity

### Explain Reasoning (Chain of Thought)
- Walk through the step-by-step thinking process
- Reveal underlying assumptions and decision points
- Show how conclusions were reached from current role's perspective
- Make implicit knowledge explicit

### Critique and Refine
- Review output for flaws, inconsistencies, or improvement areas
- Identify specific weaknesses from role's expertise
- Suggest refined version reflecting domain knowledge
- Focus on actionable improvements

## Structural Analysis Methods

### Analyze Logical Flow and Dependencies
- Examine content structure for logical progression
- Check internal consistency and coherence
- Identify and validate dependencies between elements
- Confirm effective ordering and sequencing
- Suggest reorganization if needed

### Assess Alignment with Overall Goals
- Evaluate content contribution to stated objectives
- Identify any misalignments or gaps
- Interpret alignment from specific role's perspective
- Suggest adjustments to better serve goals
- Ensure value delivery

## Risk and Challenge Methods

### Identify Potential Risks and Unforeseen Issues
- Brainstorm potential risks from role's expertise
- Identify overlooked edge cases or scenarios
- Anticipate unintended consequences
- Highlight implementation challenges
- Propose mitigation strategies

### Challenge from Critical Perspective
- Adopt critical stance on current content
- Play devil's advocate from specified viewpoint
- Argue against proposal highlighting weaknesses
- Apply YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principles
- Question fundamental assumptions

## Creative Exploration Methods

### Tree of Thoughts Deep Dive
- Break problem into discrete "thoughts" or intermediate steps
- Explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously
- Use self-evaluation to classify paths: "sure", "likely", or "impossible"
- Apply search algorithms (BFS/DFS) to find optimal solution paths
- Document reasoning branches

### Hindsight is 20/20 Reflection
- Imagine retrospective scenario based on current content
- Identify the one "if only we had known/done X..." insight
- Describe imagined consequences (can be dramatic for effect)
- Extract actionable learnings for current context
- Apply lessons preemptively

### Innovation Tournament
- Generate multiple competing solutions
- Pit ideas against each other
- Evaluate based on specific criteria
- Crown a winner with justification
- Combine best elements

## Multi-Persona Collaboration Methods

### Agile Team Perspective Shift
- **Product Owner**: Focus on user value and business impact
- **Scrum Master**: Examine process flow and team dynamics
- **Developer**: Assess technical implementation and complexity
- **QA**: Identify testing scenarios and quality concerns
- **UX Designer**: Consider user experience and usability

### Stakeholder Roundtable
- Convene virtual meeting with multiple personas
- Each persona contributes unique perspective on content
- Identify conflicts and synergies between viewpoints
- Synthesize insights into actionable recommendations
- Find balanced solutions

### Red Team vs Blue Team
- **Red Team**: Attack the proposal, find vulnerabilities
- **Blue Team**: Defend and strengthen the proposal
- Adversarial collaboration reveals weaknesses
- Strengthens final solution through opposition
- Documents both risks and mitigations

## Advanced Analytical Techniques

### Self-Consistency Validation
- Generate multiple reasoning paths for same problem
- Compare consistency across different approaches
- Identify most reliable and robust solution
- Highlight areas where approaches diverge and why
- Build confidence through convergence

### ReWOO (Reasoning Without Observation)
- Separate parametric reasoning from tool-based actions
- Create reasoning plan without external dependencies
- Identify what can be solved through pure reasoning
- Optimize for efficiency and reduced complexity
- Document reasoning chain

### Meta-Prompting Analysis
- Step back to analyze the structure and logic of current approach
- Question the format and methodology being used
- Suggest alternative frameworks or mental models
- Optimize the elicitation process itself
- Improve meta-cognitive awareness

### Escape Room Challenge
- Present content as puzzle to be solved
- Add artificial constraints or limitations
- Force creative problem-solving
- Reveal hidden assumptions through constraints
- Generate novel solutions

### Time Travel Consultation
- **Past**: What would experts 10 years ago say?
- **Future**: What would experts 10 years from now say?
- Identify timeless vs temporal elements
- Consider technology evolution
- Extract enduring principles

## Specialized Domain Methods

### Technical Deep Dive
- Examine implementation details
- Consider performance implications
- Evaluate scalability factors
- Review security considerations
- Assess maintainability

### User Experience Journey
- Map end-to-end user flow
- Identify friction points
- Consider emotional journey
- Evaluate accessibility
- Optimize for delight

### Business Impact Analysis
- Quantify value proposition
- Identify revenue/cost implications
- Consider competitive advantage
- Evaluate market fit
- Project ROI
