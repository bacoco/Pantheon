# /gods - One Command, All Gods

## How It Works

Type `/gods` followed by what you want. The right god gets summoned automatically.

## Examples

### Single Tasks
```bash
/gods explain how JWT tokens work              → Hermes
/gods write PRD for chat application          → Thoth  
/gods design a modern dashboard                → Iris
/gods plan microservices architecture         → Athena
/gods build user authentication               → Hephaestus
/gods test the login endpoint                 → Apollo
/gods fix the logout bug                      → Hephaestus
/gods review my code                          → Oracle
/gods check for security issues               → Argus
/gods document the API                        → Calliope
/gods commit and push                         → Githeus
```

### Complete Projects
```bash
/gods create complete todo app with authentication
```

This automatically chains:
1. Thoth → PRD
2. Athena → Architecture
3. Iris → UI Design
4. Hephaestus → Build
5. Apollo → Test
6. Calliope → Docs
7. Githeus → Commit & Push

## That's It

No need to remember god names. No need for multiple commands. Just:

`/gods [what you want]`

The gods handle the rest.
