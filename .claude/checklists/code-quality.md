# Code Quality Checklist

## Purpose

Comprehensive checklist for reviewing code quality to ensure maintainability, readability, and adherence to best practices.

## When to Use

- Before submitting pull requests
- During code review process
- As part of refactoring efforts
- For quality gates in CI/CD

## Review Categories

### 1. Code Structure & Organization

- [ ] **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function has one clear purpose
- [ ] **Appropriate Size**: Functions < 50 lines, classes < 500 lines (guideline)
- [ ] **Logical Organization**: Related code is grouped together
- [ ] **Consistent Structure**: Similar problems solved in similar ways
- [ ] **No Duplication**: DRY principle followed, no copy-paste code
- [ ] **Clear Dependencies**: Dependencies are explicit and minimal

**Action if issues**: Refactor to improve structure

### 2. Naming & Readability

- [ ] **Descriptive Names**: Variables, functions, classes have clear names
- [ ] **Consistent Naming**: Follows language/project conventions
- [ ] **No Abbreviations**: Full words used (except common ones like 'id')
- [ ] **Intent Clear**: Code reads like well-written prose
- [ ] **No Magic Numbers**: Constants have descriptive names
- [ ] **Meaningful Comments**: Comments explain "why", not "what"

**Action if issues**: Rename for clarity

### 3. Error Handling

- [ ] **All Errors Handled**: No silent failures
- [ ] **Appropriate Responses**: Errors handled at right level
- [ ] **User-Friendly Messages**: Error messages helpful to users
- [ ] **Logging Present**: Errors logged with context
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**: System continues when possible
- [ ] **No Empty Catches**: All catch blocks have purpose

**Action if issues**: Add proper error handling

### 4. Testing Coverage

- [ ] **Unit Tests Present**: Core logic has unit tests
- [ ] **Edge Cases Tested**: Boundary conditions covered
- [ ] **Happy Path Tested**: Normal flow verified
- [ ] **Error Cases Tested**: Failure scenarios validated
- [ ] **Tests Are Clear**: Test names describe what they verify
- [ ] **Tests Are Fast**: Unit tests run quickly

**Action if missing**: Write additional tests

### 5. Security Considerations

- [ ] **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
- [ ] **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Credentials in config/env vars
- [ ] **SQL Injection Safe**: Parameterized queries used
- [ ] **XSS Prevention**: Output properly escaped
- [ ] **Authentication Checked**: Access controls enforced
- [ ] **Secure Communication**: Sensitive data encrypted

**Action if vulnerabilities**: Fix immediately

### 6. Performance

- [ ] **Efficient Algorithms**: Appropriate data structures used
- [ ] **No Premature Optimization**: Optimization based on metrics
- [ ] **Database Queries Optimized**: Proper indexes, no N+1
- [ ] **Caching Used Appropriately**: Cache invalidation handled
- [ ] **Resource Management**: Connections/files properly closed
- [ ] **Async When Needed**: I/O operations non-blocking

**Action if slow**: Profile and optimize hot paths

### 7. Documentation

- [ ] **Public APIs Documented**: All public interfaces have docs
- [ ] **Complex Logic Explained**: Tricky parts have comments
- [ ] **Examples Provided**: Usage examples where helpful
- [ ] **Assumptions Stated**: Prerequisites documented
- [ ] **TODOs Tracked**: Technical debt noted with tickets
- [ ] **README Updated**: Setup/usage instructions current

**Action if missing**: Add documentation

### 8. Code Style & Standards

- [ ] **Style Guide Followed**: Matches project conventions
- [ ] **Linter Passing**: No linting errors/warnings
- [ ] **Formatting Consistent**: Code properly formatted
- [ ] **Imports Organized**: Imports grouped and sorted
- [ ] **No Commented Code**: Dead code removed
- [ ] **Version Control Clean**: No debugging code committed

**Action if issues**: Run formatter and fix style

### 9. Design Patterns & Principles

- [ ] **SOLID Principles**: Code follows SOLID where applicable
- [ ] **Patterns Used Appropriately**: No over-engineering
- [ ] **Loose Coupling**: Components can change independently
- [ ] **High Cohesion**: Related functionality grouped
- [ ] **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies injected, not created
- [ ] **Interface Segregation**: Interfaces focused and minimal

**Action if violated**: Refactor design

### 10. Maintainability

- [ ] **Easy to Modify**: Changes don't cascade widely
- [ ] **Easy to Test**: Code structured for testability
- [ ] **Easy to Debug**: Clear flow and good logging
- [ ] **Easy to Understand**: New developers can comprehend
- [ ] **Configuration External**: Settings not hardcoded
- [ ] **Backward Compatible**: Changes don't break existing code

**Action if concerns**: Improve modularity
