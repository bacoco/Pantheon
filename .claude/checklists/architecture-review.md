# Architecture Review Checklist

## Purpose

Comprehensive checklist for reviewing system architecture to ensure completeness, quality, and alignment with best practices.

## When to Use

- After creating initial architecture document
- Before major system implementation
- During architecture evolution planning
- For periodic architecture health checks

## Review Categories

### 1. Completeness Check

- [ ] **Problem Statement Clear**: Is the problem being solved clearly articulated?
- [ ] **Stakeholders Identified**: Are all stakeholders and their concerns documented?
- [ ] **System Boundaries Defined**: Are system boundaries and scope explicit?
- [ ] **All Components Documented**: Is every major component described?
- [ ] **Integration Points Listed**: Are all external dependencies identified?
- [ ] **Non-Functional Requirements**: Are performance, security, reliability goals specified?

**Action if incomplete**: Return to architect with specific gaps to fill

### 2. Design Quality

- [ ] **Separation of Concerns**: Are components properly decoupled?
- [ ] **Single Responsibility**: Does each component have a clear, focused purpose?
- [ ] **Interface Design**: Are APIs and contracts well-defined?
- [ ] **Data Flow Clarity**: Is data flow through the system clear and logical?
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Are failure modes and error handling addressed?
- [ ] **Consistency**: Are patterns and conventions consistent throughout?

**Action if issues found**: Document specific design concerns for refinement

### 3. Scalability & Performance

- [ ] **Scale Targets Defined**: Are specific scale targets documented?
- [ ] **Bottlenecks Identified**: Are potential bottlenecks acknowledged?
- [ ] **Scaling Strategy**: Is horizontal/vertical scaling approach clear?
- [ ] **Caching Strategy**: Is caching used appropriately?
- [ ] **Database Design**: Will database design support scale requirements?
- [ ] **Performance Budget**: Are performance targets/budgets defined?

**Action if gaps**: Create specific scalability improvement tasks

### 4. Security Architecture

- [ ] **Authentication Defined**: Is authentication mechanism specified?
- [ ] **Authorization Model**: Is authorization clearly designed?
- [ ] **Data Classification**: Is sensitive data identified and protected?
- [ ] **Encryption Standards**: Are encryption requirements defined?
- [ ] **Security Boundaries**: Are trust boundaries clearly marked?
- [ ] **Compliance Addressed**: Are regulatory requirements considered?
- [ ] **Threat Model**: Has threat modeling been performed?

**Action if vulnerabilities**: Escalate to security specialist immediately

### 5. Operational Readiness

- [ ] **Deployment Strategy**: Is deployment approach documented?
- [ ] **Monitoring Plan**: Are monitoring and alerting defined?
- [ ] **Logging Strategy**: Is centralized logging planned?
- [ ] **Backup/Recovery**: Are backup and recovery procedures defined?
- [ ] **Runbook Items**: Are operational procedures considered?
- [ ] **SLA/SLO Defined**: Are service level objectives specified?

**Action if missing**: Create operational readiness plan

### 6. Technology Decisions

- [ ] **Tech Stack Justified**: Is each technology choice rationalized?
- [ ] **Alternatives Considered**: Were alternatives evaluated?
- [ ] **Team Expertise**: Does team have required expertise?
- [ ] **License Compliance**: Are all licenses compatible?
- [ ] **Vendor Lock-in**: Is vendor lock-in risk assessed?
- [ ] **Tech Debt**: Is technical debt acknowledged and planned?

**Action if concerns**: Schedule technology review session

### 7. Risk Assessment

- [ ] **Risks Identified**: Are major risks documented?
- [ ] **Mitigation Plans**: Does each risk have mitigation strategy?
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Are critical dependencies identified?
- [ ] **Assumptions**: Are assumptions explicitly stated?
- [ ] **Constraints**: Are constraints clearly documented?
- [ ] **Trade-offs**: Are architectural trade-offs explained?

**Action if high risk**: Develop detailed risk mitigation plan

### 8. Evolution & Maintenance

- [ ] **Evolution Path**: Is future evolution considered?
- [ ] **Deprecation Strategy**: Is there a plan for deprecating components?
- [ ] **Version Strategy**: Is versioning approach defined?
- [ ] **Migration Plans**: Are data/schema migration strategies defined?
- [ ] **Documentation Plan**: Is documentation maintenance planned?
- [ ] **Knowledge Transfer**: Is knowledge transfer considered?

**Action if unclear**: Define architecture roadmap

### 9. Cost Considerations

- [ ] **Infrastructure Costs**: Are infrastructure costs estimated?
- [ ] **License Costs**: Are all license costs accounted for?
- [ ] **Operational Costs**: Are ongoing operational costs considered?
- [ ] **Development Effort**: Is implementation effort realistic?
- [ ] **Cost Optimization**: Are cost optimization opportunities identified?

**Action if over budget**: Identify cost reduction opportunities

### 10. Quality Attributes

- [ ] **Testability**: Is the system designed for testing?
- [ ] **Maintainability**: Will the system be maintainable?
- [ ] **Reliability**: Are reliability requirements addressed?
- [ ] **Usability**: Is user experience considered in design?
- [ ] **Flexibility**: Can the system adapt to changing requirements?
- [ ] **Observability**: Can system behavior be understood in production?

**Action if concerns**: Define specific quality improvement tasks
