# 📜 Sacred Scroll Workflow Example

## Project: Real-Time Chat Application

This example demonstrates a complete BMAD-Pantheon workflow for building a real-time chat application using the two-phase approach with Sacred Scrolls.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a real-time chat application with:
- User authentication
- Real-time messaging
- Chat rooms
- File sharing
- Message history

**Timeline**: 2 weeks  
**Team**: 2 developers  
**Tech Stack**: Next.js, Socket.io, PostgreSQL, Redis

---

## 📋 Phase 1: Planning (Days 1-3)

### Step 1: Initialize Workflow
```javascript
// Start the two-phase workflow with Chronos
const workflowId = await Task("chronos", `
  Start two-phase workflow: Real-Time Chat Application
  Timeline: 2 weeks
  Team: 2 developers
  Priority: MVP for startup demo
`);

console.log(`Workflow initiated: ${workflowId}`);
// Output: Workflow initiated: workflow-chat-20240320
```

### Step 2: Create Sacred Scroll
```javascript
// Mnemosyne creates the context container
const scrollId = await Task("mnemosyne", `
  Create sacred scroll for: Real-Time Chat Application
  Type: Web application
  Stakeholders: CEO (priority: quick launch), CTO (priority: scalability)
  Context: Startup needs MVP for investor demo in 2 weeks
`);

console.log(`Sacred Scroll created: ${scrollId}`);
// Output: Sacred Scroll created: scroll-a4f8c2d1-1679337600000
```

### Step 3: Requirements Gathering with Moirai
```javascript
// Clotho spins the requirements thread
await Task("moirai", `
  Clotho: Gather requirements for Real-Time Chat
  
  User Stories:
  - As a user, I want to sign up with email/password
  - As a user, I want to send real-time messages
  - As a user, I want to create and join chat rooms
  - As a user, I want to share files up to 10MB
  - As a user, I want to see message history
  - As a user, I want to see who's online
  - As a user, I want to edit/delete my messages
  - As a user, I want push notifications (mobile)
  
  Non-Functional Requirements:
  - Support 1000 concurrent users
  - Message delivery < 100ms
  - 99.9% uptime
  - GDPR compliant
  - Mobile responsive
  
  Constraints:
  - Budget: $5000/month for infrastructure
  - Timeline: 2 weeks to MVP
  - Team: 2 developers
  - Must work on mobile browsers
`);

// Update Sacred Scroll
await Task("mnemosyne", `
  Update scroll ${scrollId} with requirements
  Section: planning.requirements
`);
```

### Step 4: Architecture Design with Athena
```javascript
// Athena designs the system architecture
await Task("athena", `
  Design architecture for Real-Time Chat
  Scroll: ${scrollId}
  
  Requirements from scroll: Real-time, 1000 users, <100ms latency
  
  Proposed Architecture:
  - Frontend: Next.js with Socket.io client
  - Backend: Node.js with Socket.io server
  - Database: PostgreSQL for persistent data
  - Cache: Redis for sessions and real-time data
  - File Storage: AWS S3 for uploads
  - Deployment: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend)
  
  Key Decisions:
  - Socket.io over raw WebSockets (for reconnection handling)
  - PostgreSQL over MongoDB (ACID compliance for messages)
  - Redis for presence system (who's online)
  - JWT tokens for authentication
  - Horizontal scaling ready (Redis pub/sub)
`);

// Document in Sacred Scroll
await Task("mnemosyne", `
  Update scroll ${scrollId} 
  Section: planning.architecture
  God: athena
  Action: system_design_complete
`);
```

### Step 5: Scope Definition with Moirai
```javascript
// Lachesis measures the scope
await Task("moirai", `
  Lachesis: Measure scope for Real-Time Chat
  
  Effort Estimation:
  - Authentication: 2 days (1 dev)
  - Real-time messaging: 3 days (1 dev)
  - Chat rooms: 2 days (1 dev)
  - File sharing: 2 days (1 dev)
  - Message history: 1 day (1 dev)
  - Online presence: 1 day (1 dev)
  - Edit/delete messages: 1 day (1 dev)
  - Push notifications: 3 days (1 dev)
  
  Total: 15 developer-days
  Available: 20 developer-days (2 devs × 10 days)
  Buffer: 5 days for testing and fixes
  
  Resource Allocation:
  - Developer 1: Auth + Real-time + Rooms (7 days)
  - Developer 2: Files + History + Presence + Edit (5 days)
  - Both: Testing + Bug fixes (3 days)
  
  Risk Assessment:
  - High: Real-time scaling beyond 1000 users
  - Medium: File upload security
  - Low: Basic authentication
`);
```

### Step 6: Final Decisions with Moirai
```javascript
// Atropos makes the cuts
await Task("moirai", `
  Atropos: Make final decisions for MVP
  
  INCLUDED in MVP:
  ✅ Email/password authentication
  ✅ Real-time messaging
  ✅ Basic chat rooms (public only)
  ✅ File sharing (images only, 5MB max)
  ✅ Last 100 messages history
  ✅ Online presence indicators
  
  CUT from MVP (Phase 2):
  ❌ Social login (Google, GitHub)
  ❌ Private/encrypted rooms
  ❌ Video/audio files
  ❌ Infinite scroll history
  ❌ Message edit/delete
  ❌ Push notifications
  ❌ User profiles/avatars
  ❌ Message reactions
  
  Rationale for cuts:
  - Focus on core chat functionality
  - Reduce complexity for 2-week deadline
  - Minimize security surface area
  - Defer nice-to-haves
`);

// Record decisions in Sacred Scroll
await Task("mnemosyne", `
  Update scroll ${scrollId}
  Section: planning.decisions
  Content: MVP scope decisions with rationale
`);
```

### Step 7: Hyper-Detailed Documentation
```javascript
// Hypergraphia documents everything
await Task("hypergraphia", `
  Create hyper-detailed planning documentation
  Scroll: ${scrollId}
  
  Document:
  - Every requirement and why it matters
  - Every architecture decision and alternatives considered
  - Every scope cut and the reasoning
  - Every risk and mitigation strategy
  - Every assumption made
  - Every dependency identified
  - Every success metric defined
  
  Include context:
  - Startup is pre-revenue, needs demo for Series A
  - CEO previously had bad experience with delayed launch
  - CTO worried about technical debt from rushing
  - Competing against Slack but for younger demographic
  - Investor demo is March 31st, no flexibility
  
  Detail level: MAXIMUM
  Target audience: Future AI agents who will implement
`);
```

### Step 8: Planning Validation
```javascript
// Chronos validates planning is complete
const planningValidation = await Task("chronos", `
  Validate planning phase complete
  Scroll: ${scrollId}
  
  Checklist:
  ✓ Requirements documented
  ✓ Architecture defined
  ✓ Scope measured
  ✓ Decisions made
  ✓ Risks identified
  ✓ Timeline set
  ✓ Resources allocated
  ✓ Success metrics defined
`);

if (planningValidation.passed) {
  console.log("✅ Planning phase complete!");
  console.log("Ready for execution phase");
} else {
  console.log("❌ Planning incomplete:");
  console.log(planningValidation.missing);
  // Address missing items...
}
```

  - Secure URL generation
`);
```

### Step 11: Quality Validation with Apollo
```javascript

  Validate implementation quality
  Scroll: ${execScrollId}
  
  Test against requirements:
  ✓ Authentication working
  ✓ Messages deliver < 100ms
  ✓ File upload < 5MB enforced
  ✓ 100 message history loads
  ✓ Online presence updates
  
  Security validation:
  ✓ SQL injection prevented
  ✓ XSS protection enabled

  ✓ Rate limiting implemented
  ✓ JWT properly validated
  
  Performance testing:
  ✓ 1000 concurrent connections handled
  ✓ Message latency < 100ms at load
  ✓ Memory usage stable
`);
```

### Step 12: Documentation with Hypergraphia
```javascript
// Document implementation details
await Task("hypergraphia", `
  Create implementation story
  Scroll: ${execScrollId}
  
  Document:
  - Every implementation decision and why
  - Every bug encountered and how it was fixed
  - Every optimization made
  - Every security consideration
  - Every test written
  - Every known limitation
  
  Specific details to preserve:
  - JWT secret rotation strategy
  - Redis connection pooling settings
  - Socket.io reconnection parameters
  - S3 bucket CORS configuration
  - PostgreSQL index decisions
  - That weird Safari WebSocket bug workaround
  - Why we used JWT instead of sessions
  - The 2am debugging session that found the race condition
  
  Future considerations:
  - How to add end-to-end encryption
  - Scaling beyond 1000 users
  - Adding video chat
  - Migration path to microservices
`);
