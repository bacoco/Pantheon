# Interactive BACO Init Demo

This demonstrates how the enhanced `/baco init` command works with caching and knowledge base integration.

## Example Conversation Flow

### User initiates BACO
```
User: /baco init
```

### BACO responds with welcome
```
BACO: üéØ Welcome to BACO Interactive Project Setup!

I'll help you create a comprehensive project definition through conversation.
This will help me understand your needs and generate a customized baco.md file.

Let's start with the basics...

1Ô∏è‚É£ What type of application are you building?
   (e.g., Web App, REST API, CLI Tool, Mobile Backend, Desktop App, etc.)
```

### User specifies project type
```
User: I'm building a REST API with FastAPI
```

### BACO loads knowledge base instantly
```
BACO: Excellent choice! FastAPI is perfect for modern Python APIs. 

üìö Loading FastAPI knowledge base...

Based on my knowledge of FastAPI:
‚Ä¢ Automatic API documentation at /docs
‚Ä¢ Built-in data validation with Pydantic
‚Ä¢ Native async/await support for high performance
‚Ä¢ Dependency injection system

Let me ask a few more questions to understand your specific needs...

2Ô∏è‚É£ What's the main purpose or problem your API solves?
```

### User describes purpose
```
User: It's a task management API for a team collaboration tool
```

### BACO shows understanding
```
BACO: Great! A task management API for team collaboration. This typically involves:
- User authentication and authorization
- Task CRUD operations
- Team/project organization
- Real-time updates (possibly)
- Activity tracking

3Ô∏è‚É£ Who are your target users?
   (e.g., developers, businesses, consumers, internal team)
```

### User provides context
```
User: Small to medium businesses, teams of 5-50 people
```

### BACO continues gathering info
```
BACO: Perfect, targeting small to medium business teams. This suggests:
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Role-based permissions
- Good performance for concurrent users
- Simple but effective UI/UX

4Ô∏è‚É£ What's the expected scale?
   (e.g., prototype, small team use, enterprise, global service)
```

### User specifies scale
```
User: Starting with 100 companies, growing to 1000+ within a year
```

### BACO acknowledges scale requirements
```
BACO: That's solid growth planning! Starting with 100 companies and scaling to 1000+ means we need:
- Scalable architecture from the start
- Efficient database design
- Caching strategy
- Background job processing

5Ô∏è‚É£ Do you have a timeline or deadline?
```

### User provides timeline
```
User: MVP in 3 months, full launch in 6 months
```

### BACO moves to features
```
BACO: Understood - 3 months to MVP, 6 months to full launch. Let's prioritize features accordingly.

Now let's explore your features. I'll help you organize them by priority.

What are the core features your task management API must have for the MVP?
(You can list them all at once, or we can go through them one by one)
```

### User lists features
```
User: User registration and login, create/edit/delete tasks, assign tasks to team members, 
project organization, basic notifications
```

### BACO organizes and suggests
```
BACO: Excellent! Let me organize these for your MVP and suggest some related features:

HIGH PRIORITY (MVP):
‚úÖ User Authentication
   - Registration with email verification
   - Login with JWT tokens
   - Password reset functionality

‚úÖ Task Management
   - Create, read, update, delete tasks
   - Task status (todo, in-progress, done)
   - Due dates and priorities

‚úÖ Team Collaboration  
   - Assign tasks to team members
   - View team members' tasks
   - Basic permissions

‚úÖ Project Organization
   - Create projects/workspaces
   - Organize tasks within projects
   - Project-level permissions

‚úÖ Basic Notifications
   - Email notifications for assignments
   - In-app notification system

Would you like me to suggest some MEDIUM priority features for post-MVP?
```

### User agrees
```
User: Yes, what would you recommend?
```

### BACO suggests based on domain knowledge
```
BACO: Based on task management best practices, here are recommended post-MVP features:

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Post-MVP):
üîî Advanced Notifications
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket
   - Notification preferences
   - Mobile push notifications

üìä Analytics & Reporting
   - Task completion metrics
   - Team productivity dashboard  
   - Export reports

üè∑Ô∏è Task Enhancements
   - Labels/tags for categorization
   - Task dependencies
   - Recurring tasks
   - File attachments

üí¨ Collaboration Features
   - Task comments
   - @mentions
   - Activity feed

üîç Search & Filters
   - Full-text task search
   - Advanced filtering
   - Saved filters

Do any of these resonate with your vision?
```

### User confirms and asks about tech
```
User: Yes, especially real-time updates and search. What about the technical stack?
```

### BACO provides technical guidance
```
BACO: Let's talk about technical requirements...

üõ†Ô∏è Based on FastAPI and your requirements, I recommend:

**Core Stack:**
‚Ä¢ FastAPI (you've chosen wisely!)
‚Ä¢ PostgreSQL - Best for relational data with JSONB for flexibility
‚Ä¢ SQLAlchemy + Alembic - ORM and migrations
‚Ä¢ Redis - Caching and real-time features
‚Ä¢ Celery - Background tasks (emails, reports)

**For Real-time Updates:**
‚Ä¢ WebSockets via FastAPI
‚Ä¢ Redis Pub/Sub for scaling

**Authentication:**
‚Ä¢ python-jose for JWT
‚Ä¢ passlib for password hashing

üìö Do you have any documentation or examples to share?
   (URLs, file paths, or paste code examples)
```

### User provides documentation
```
User: Here's our auth pattern: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/oauth2-jwt/
And we follow this style guide: <pastes code example>
```

### BACO uses cache and analyzes
```
BACO: üìö Checking documentation cache... Found recent analysis!

From the FastAPI JWT tutorial:
‚úì OAuth2 with Password flow
‚úì JWT tokens with expiration
‚úì Dependency injection for current user
‚úì Password hashing with bcrypt

From your code example, I detect:
‚úì Snake_case naming convention
‚úì Type hints throughout
‚úì Async/await pattern
‚úì Repository pattern for data access
‚úì Comprehensive error handling

These patterns will be reflected in the generated baco.md.

üîß Any specific technical constraints?
   (database, performance, security, compliance)
```

### User specifies constraints
```
User: Yes, we need GDPR compliance, <100ms API response time, and it must run on AWS
```

### BACO captures constraints
```
BACO: Important constraints noted:

‚ö° Performance:
- <100ms API response time
- Will require caching strategy
- Database query optimization
- Connection pooling

üîí Compliance:
- GDPR compliance needed
- Data privacy features
- User data export/deletion
- Audit logging

‚òÅÔ∏è Infrastructure:
- AWS deployment
- Consider ECS or Lambda
- RDS for PostgreSQL
- ElastiCache for Redis

Almost done! Any other considerations like budget limits or team expertise?
```

### User wraps up
```
User: Team has Python experience but new to FastAPI. Budget is moderate.
```

```

## Key Improvements Demonstrated

1. **Instant Knowledge Base Access**: When user mentioned FastAPI, BACO immediately loaded relevant information without waiting for documentation fetch.

2. **Cached Documentation**: The FastAPI OAuth2 tutorial was already cached, providing instant insights.

3. **Pattern Detection**: Analyzed the user's code example to detect conventions.

4. **Smart Suggestions**: Based on domain knowledge of task management apps, suggested relevant features.

5. **Contextual Constraints**: Performance requirements influenced technical recommendations (caching, connection pooling).

6. **Comprehensive Output**: The generated baco.md is highly customized, not generic, incorporating all learned context.

This enhanced experience makes `/baco init` feel like talking to an expert who already knows the frameworks and best practices, rather than starting from scratch each time.
