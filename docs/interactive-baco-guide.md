# Interactive Pantheon Guide

## Overview

Pantheon now features a fully interactive workflow that guides you through the entire development process without requiring multiple manual commands. This creates a seamless, conversational experience from project definition to code implementation.

## The Interactive Flow

### Starting Your Project

```bash
/baco init
```

Instead of just creating a file, Pantheon now:
1. Asks intelligent questions about your project
2. Offers to create a development plan immediately
3. Can transition directly to implementation
4. Maintains context throughout the entire process

### Complete Example Flow

Here's what you'll experience:

```
You: /baco init

Pantheon: üéØ Welcome to Pantheon Interactive Project Setup!
      [Asks about your project type, features, timeline...]
      
      ‚úÖ Created baco.md!
      Would you like me to create a development plan now? (y/n)

You: y

Pantheon: [Generates comprehensive plan]
      
      What would you like to do with this plan?
      1. üöÄ Generate implementation blueprint (PRP)
      2. üìù Modify the plan
      3. üíæ Save plan for later
      4. ‚ùå Start over
      
      Your choice (1-4):

You: 1

Pantheon: ‚úÖ PRP Generated: baco-prp-20250120.md
      
      What would you like to do next?
      1. üöÄ Start implementing immediately
      2. üìÑ Review the PRP first
      3. ‚úèÔ∏è Modify the plan
      4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Pause for now
      
      Your choice (1-4):

You: 1

Pantheon: Great! Let's start implementing...
      [Shows phases, begins coding, provides updates]
      
      ‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete!
      Ready to proceed with Phase 2? (y/n):

You: y

[Continues until project is complete]
```

## Key Features

### 1. Seamless Transitions
- No need to copy/paste file names
- No need to remember command sequences
- Natural progression from one step to the next

### 2. Progress Tracking
- Visual progress indicators
- Phase completion summaries
- File creation notifications
- Real-time status updates

### 3. Interruption Handling
You can pause at any time:
```
Pantheon: Ready to proceed with Phase 2? (y/n):
You: pause

Pantheon: ‚è∏Ô∏è Session paused. Your progress has been saved.
      Resume anytime with '/baco resume'
```

### 4. Smart Resumption
```
You: /baco resume

Pantheon: Found paused session: Mobile AI Image Generator
      Progress: Phase 2 of 4 (40% complete)
      Last action: Created layout components
      
      Resume where you left off? (y/n):
```

## Interactive Commands

### During Execution
While Pantheon is working, you can:
- Type "pause" to save progress and stop
- Type "status" to see current progress
- Type "skip" to skip current step (with confirmation)
- Answer "n" to any continuation prompt to pause

### Choice Prompts
When presented with numbered options:
- Type the number (1-4) to select
- Type "help" for more information
- Type "back" to return to previous step

## Benefits

1. **Lower Learning Curve**: No need to memorize command sequences
2. **Faster Development**: Seamless flow reduces friction
3. **Better Context**: Pantheon maintains understanding throughout
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of issues with options
5. **Natural Experience**: Feels like pair programming with an expert

## Tips for Best Experience

1. **Be Specific**: During init, provide detailed requirements
2. **Trust the Flow**: Let Pantheon guide you through the process
3. **Review Checkpoints**: Take time at phase completions to review
4. **Use Pause**: Don't hesitate to pause and return later
5. **Provide Feedback**: Answer prompts thoughtfully for best results

## Comparison: Old vs New

### Old Flow (Multiple Commands)
```bash
/baco init
# Edit baco.md manually
/baco plan
/baco execute
/execute-prp baco-prp-20250120.md
```

### New Flow (Interactive)
```bash
/baco init
# Answer questions, everything else happens automatically
```

## Advanced Usage

### Skipping Steps
If you already have a baco.md file:
```bash
/baco plan
# Offers to proceed to implementation automatically
```

### Direct Execution
If you want to jump straight to coding:
```bash
/baco execute
# Still provides interactive options
```

### Custom Workflows
Create your own interactive workflows:
```bash
/workflow analysis-to-implementation
# Guided multi-agent collaboration
```

## Troubleshooting

### Session Issues
If something goes wrong:
```bash
/baco status     # Check current session
/baco reset      # Clear all sessions (with confirmation)
/baco resume     # Try to resume
```

### Getting Help
At any prompt:
- Type "help" for context-sensitive assistance
- Type "?" for available options
- Type "back" to go to previous step

## Future Enhancements

Coming soon:
- Voice input support
- Collaborative sessions
- Custom interaction styles
- Integration with IDEs
- Real-time preview of changes

The interactive Pantheon makes AI-assisted development feel natural and effortless. No more command memorization - just describe what you want and let Pantheon guide you through making it real.
