## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start with `QUICK-START.md`** - Provides the implementation roadmap
2. **Use each numbered file sequentially with Claude Code** - Each builds on the previous
3. **Test as you go** - Each component has specific success criteria

## 📋 Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (30-45 mins)
- Use `00-PROJECT-SETUP.md` to create project structure
- Initialize dependencies and configuration
- Verify basic CLI runs

### Phase 2: Core Components (2-3 hours)
1. **Complexity Analyzer** (`01-COMPLEXITY-ANALYZER.md`)
   - Implement LLM-based project analysis
   - Multi-dimensional complexity scoring
   
2. **Agent System** (`02-AGENT-SYSTEM.md`)
   - Base agent class and specialist implementations
   - Dynamic agent activation logic
   
3. **Context Management** (`03-CONTEXT-MANAGEMENT.md`)
   - Progressive context building
   - Intelligent compression
   - Pattern memory system

### Phase 3: Integration (1-2 hours)
4. **Orchestrator** (`04-ORCHESTRATOR.md`)
   - Ties all components together
   - Implements adaptive agent selection
   
5. **CLI Interface** (`05-CLI-INTERFACE.md`)
   - User-friendly commands
   - Rich output formatting

### Phase 4: Quality (1 hour)
6. **Testing & Validation** (`06-TESTING-VALIDATION.md`)
   - Unit and integration tests
   - Performance benchmarks

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Adaptive Complexity
BACO automatically scales the number of specialist agents based on project complexity:
- **Simple**: 2 agents (Developer + QA)
- **Moderate**: 4 agents (+ Architect, Security)
- **Complex**: 8+ agents (+ Performance, DevOps, etc.)

### Recursive AI Architecture
BACO uses LLMs to make meta-decisions about:
- Which agents to activate
- How to compress context
- Which patterns to remember

### Progressive Context Building
Instead of front-loading all context, BACO builds it incrementally:
1. Project overview
2. Technical requirements
3. Architecture decisions
4. Implementation details
5. Testing strategy

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

After implementing BACO, you'll have:
- A CLI tool that generates enhanced PRPs (Product Requirements Prompts)
- Automatic agent selection based on project complexity
- Pattern learning from successful implementations
- Token-efficient orchestration
- Beautiful terminal output with progress indicators

## 📝 Example Usage

```bash
# Simple project
baco plan --project "TODO API" --tech-stack "Python" --output todo.prp

# Complex project with live agent deliberation
baco plan \
  --project "Microservices e-commerce platform" \
  --requirements "Real-time inventory" \
  --requirements "Payment processing" \
  --tech-stack "Kubernetes" \
  --tech-stack "Kafka" \
  --live
```

## 🛠️ Tips for Claude Code

1. **Process each file completely** - Don't skip sections
2. **Include all imports** - Each file shows required dependencies
3. **Follow type hints** - They guide implementation
4. **Test incrementally** - Use the test examples in each file
5. **Ask for clarification** - If something is unclear in the prompts

## 🔧 Customization

After basic implementation, you can:
- Add domain-specific agents
- Adjust complexity thresholds
- Create custom patterns
- Integrate with your CI/CD pipeline

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Requires Python 3.11+
- OpenAI API key needed
- Async architecture throughout
- Uses Poetry for dependency management

## 📚 Additional Resources

- Original BACO article analysis (review the concept)
- BMAD Method documentation (for multi-agent inspiration)
- Context Engineering guides (for PRP best practices)

Start with `QUICK-START.md` and work through each file sequentially. Each prompt is designed to be self-contained and actionable with Claude Code.

Good luck with your implementation! 🚀
