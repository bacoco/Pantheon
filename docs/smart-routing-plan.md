# BACO Smart Routing Implementation Plan

## Overview

Smart Routing is a 2-week enhancement to BACO that enables intelligent task distribution to the most appropriate agents based on their capabilities and the task requirements. This feature is inspired by SuperClaude's architecture principles.

## Goals

1. **Intelligent Task Assignment**: Automatically route tasks to agents with the best expertise
2. **Transparency**: Show users why a specific agent was chosen
3. **Performance**: Minimal latency added to task processing
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing workflows continue unchanged
5. **Analytics**: Track routing effectiveness for continuous improvement

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Smart Router (`/lib/smart-router.md`)
- Receives task requests
- Analyzes task requirements
- Matches with agent capabilities
- Returns routing decisions with confidence scores

#### 2. Task Analyzer (`/lib/task-analyzer.md`)
- Parses user requests
- Extracts domains, technologies, and complexity
- Identifies required capabilities
- Estimates task scope

#### 3. Agent Capabilities
Each agent will have enhanced metadata:
```yaml
agent:
  name: Winston
  capabilities:
    architecture-design: expert
    system-design: expert
    scalability: advanced
    cloud-patterns: intermediate
```

#### 4. Routing Command (`/commands/route.md`)
New command: `/baco route <task>`
- Shows routing analysis
- Displays selected agents
- Provides confidence scores
- Allows manual override

## Implementation Timeline

- Build simple reporting dashboard
- Set up monitoring alerts

#### Days 13-14: Polish
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation writing
- Performance optimization
- Rollout planning

## Technical Design

### Task Analysis Structure
```typescript
interface TaskAnalysis {
  domains: string[];           // ["architecture", "security"]
  technologies: string[];      // ["react", "aws"]
  complexity: number;          // 1-10 scale
  requiredCapabilities: string[]; // ["system-design", "cloud-patterns"]
  estimatedDuration: string;   // "hours", "days", "weeks"
}
```

### Routing Decision Structure
```typescript
interface RoutingDecision {
  primaryAgent: string;        // "winston"
  supportingAgents: string[];  // ["james", "marcus"]
  confidence: number;          // 0-1 scale
  reasoning: string;           // Human-readable explanation
  alternativeRoutes: Route[];  // Other valid options
}
```

### Capability Matching Algorithm
1. Parse task into required capabilities
2. Score each agent based on capability match
3. Consider workload and recent performance
4. Apply domain-specific rules
5. Return top matches with confidence scores

## Feature Flags

```javascript
const FEATURE_FLAGS = {
  ENABLE_SMART_ROUTING: false,     // Master switch
  SMART_ROUTING_PREVIEW: true,      // Show but don't execute
  ROUTING_ANALYTICS: true,          // Collect metrics
  MANUAL_OVERRIDE: true,            // Allow user to change routing
};
```

## Success Criteria

### Week 1 Checkpoint
- [ ] Smart router can analyze basic tasks
- [ ] All agents have capability definitions
- [ ] Task analyzer categorizes correctly
- [ ] No impact on existing functionality

### Week 2 Checkpoint
- [ ] `/baco route` command fully functional
- [ ] Routing integrated with workflow engine
- [ ] Analytics show routing patterns
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Overall Success Metrics
- 80%+ routing accuracy (agent handles task successfully)
- <100ms added latency for routing decision
- 0 disruption to existing workflows
- Positive user feedback on routing transparency

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Complexity**: Keep initial version simple
- **Performance**: Cache routing decisions
- **Accuracy**: Start with high-confidence matches only

### User Experience Risks
- **Confusion**: Clear explanations for all routing
- **Trust**: Allow manual override always
- **Adoption**: Gradual rollout with opt-in

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

1. **Learning System**: Improve routing based on outcomes
2. **Sub-Agent Support**: Route to specialized sub-agents
3. **Parallel Routing**: Split tasks across multiple agents
4. **Custom Rules**: User-defined routing preferences
5. **API Access**: External systems can query routing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Task analyzer accuracy
- Capability matching logic
- Routing decision generation

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end routing flow
- Workflow engine integration
- Command functionality

### Performance Tests
- Routing decision latency
- Concurrent request handling
- Cache effectiveness

### User Acceptance Tests
- Routing transparency
- Manual override flow
- Analytics accuracy

## Documentation Plan

1. **User Guide**: How to use smart routing
2. **Developer Guide**: How routing works internally
3. **Admin Guide**: Configuration and monitoring
4. **API Reference**: Interfaces and data structures

## Rollout Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Internal testing with feature flag
2. **Phase 2**: Beta users with opt-in
3. **Phase 3**: Gradual percentage rollout
4. **Phase 4**: General availability

## Monitoring & Metrics

Track these KPIs:
- Routing accuracy rate
- User override frequency
- Average routing latency
- Agent utilization balance
- User satisfaction scores

## Dependencies

- Existing agent system
- Workflow engine
- Command framework
- Analytics infrastructure

## Open Questions

1. Should routing consider agent workload?
2. How to handle multi-agent tasks?
3. What's the confidence threshold for auto-routing?
4. How to handle routing failures?

These will be answered during implementation based on testing and user feedback.
