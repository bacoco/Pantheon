  - Ensures agile best practices
- **Tools**: Task management MCPs
- **Integration**: Orchestrates team workflows

### UX & Design Team

#### **Sally** - UX Designer
- **Role**: User experience, accessibility, design systems
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Defines user experience
  - Creates UI specifications
  - Designs user flows
  - Ensures accessibility
- **Tools**: Design system MCPs, Figma integration
- **Integration**: Works with UI Enhancement team

### UI Enhancement Team (Advanced)

This specialized team was introduced to dramatically improve the quality and aesthetics of user interfaces. They work together in a dedicated workflow pipeline.

#### **Vision** - Style Guide Generator
- **Role**: Design tokens, visual consistency, brand identity
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Analyzes visual inspiration (images/URLs)
  - Extracts design token systems
  - Creates color palettes, typography scales
  - Defines spacing systems
- **Tools**: Image analysis, design token MCPs
- **Integration**: First step in UI enhancement pipeline

#### **Fusion** - Design Optimizer
- **Role**: Audience-specific UI, psychology-based design
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Takes design tokens from Vision
  - Optimizes for target audience
  - Applies design psychology principles
  - Ensures brand consistency
- **Tools**: Design optimization algorithms
- **Integration**: Refines Vision's output

#### **Motion** - Animation Specialist
- **Role**: Micro-interactions, transitions, 60fps performance
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Adds high-quality animations
  - Creates micro-interactions
  - Ensures 60fps performance
  - Implements smooth transitions
- **Tools**: Animation libraries, performance profilers
- **Integration**: Enhances static designs

#### **Voice** - Microcopy Expert
- **Role**: UI text, tone consistency, user communication
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Ensures text consistency
  - Defines brand voice
  - Optimizes microcopy
  - Creates user-friendly messages
- **Tools**: Content management MCPs
- **Integration**: Final polish in UI pipeline

### Orchestration & Analysis

#### **Baco Master** - Meta-Orchestrator
- **Role**: Cross-agent coordination, workflow optimization
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Highest-level orchestrator
  - Dynamic workflow generation
  - Coordinates all other agents
  - Universal tool access
  - Fallback for complex routing
- **Tools**: All available MCPs
- **Integration**: Central to all complex workflows

#### **Smart Routing Engine** (Implicit Agent)
While not a named persona, the Smart Router acts as an intelligent agent:
- Analyzes user prompts
- Determines required domain and complexity
- Routes tasks to appropriate agents or teams
- Handles edge cases and ambiguity

## Integration Evidence

### Commands
Agents are primary actors in multiple commands:
- `/agent` - Direct agent transformation
- `/workflow` - Multi-agent workflows
- `/route` - Smart routing to agents
- `/team` - Team-based coordination
- `/ui-improve` - UI enhancement pipeline

### Core Libraries
Agents are central to system libraries:
- `smart-router.md` - Routing logic for each agent
- `workflow-engine.md` - Agent interaction patterns
- `agent-integration.md` - MCP permissions per agent
- `mcp-permissions.md` - Tool access control

### Templates
Many agents have dedicated templates:
- `.claude/templates/agents/` - Agent-specific artifacts
- PRD templates for John
- Test plan templates for Elena
- Architecture templates for Winston

### Testing
The test file `smart-router.test.md` includes specific unit tests:
- "should route architecture tasks to Winston"
- "should route coding tasks to James"
- "should route testing tasks to Elena"

## Workflow Examples

### Product Development Workflow
```
John (PM) → Sarah (PO) → Bob (SM) → Development Team
```

### UI Enhancement Pipeline
```
Vision → Fusion → Motion → Voice
```

### Implementation Workflow
```
Winston (Architecture) → James (Development) → Elena (QA)
```

### Security Review
```
Marcus reviews all code → Provides security recommendations
```

## Evolution Notes

### BACO Orchestrator (Legacy)
The original BACO Orchestrator agent has been superseded by:
- **Baco Master** for meta-orchestration
- **Smart Routing Engine** for complexity analysis
- The file remains but is no longer actively used

## Conclusion

BACO's 13-agent system represents a sophisticated, production-ready architecture where each agent has:
- Clear responsibilities and specializations
- Dedicated tools and permissions
- Defined interaction patterns
- Specific integration points

The system's strength lies not just in individual agent capabilities, but in their orchestrated collaboration, enabling complex software development tasks to be accomplished with unprecedented efficiency and quality.
