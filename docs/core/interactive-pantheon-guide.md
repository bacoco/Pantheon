# Interactive Pantheon Guide

## Overview

Pantheon now features a fully interactive workflow that guides you through the entire development process without requiring multiple manual commands. This creates a seamless, conversational experience from project definition to code implementation.

## The Interactive Flow

### Starting Your Project

```bash
/gods init
```

Instead of just creating a file, Pantheon now:
1. Asks intelligent questions about your project
2. Offers to create a development plan immediately
3. Can transition directly to implementation
4. Maintains context throughout the entire process

### Complete Example Flow

Here's what you'll experience:

```
You: /gods init

Pantheon: üéØ Welcome to Pantheon Interactive Project Setup!
      [Asks about your project type, features, timeline...]
      
      ‚úÖ Created pantheon.md!
      Would you like me to create a development plan now? (y/n)

You: y

Pantheon: [Generates comprehensive plan]
      
      What would you like to do with this plan?
      1. üöÄ Generate implementation blueprint (PRP)
      2. üìù Modify the plan
      3. üíæ Save plan for later
      4. ‚ùå Start over
      
      Your choice (1-4):

You: 1

Pantheon: ‚úÖ PRP Generated: pantheon-prp-20250120.md
      
      What would you like to do next?
      1. üöÄ Start implementing immediately
      2. üìÑ Review the PRP first
      3. ‚úèÔ∏è Modify the plan
      4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Pause for now
      
      Your choice (1-4):

You: 1

Pantheon: Great! Let's start implementing...
      [Shows phases, begins coding, provides updates]
      
      ‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete!
      Ready to proceed with Phase 2? (y/n):

You: y

[Continues until project is complete]
```

## Key Features

### 1. Seamless Transitions
- No need to copy/paste file names
- No need to remember command sequences
- Natural progression from one step to the next

### 2. Progress Tracking
- Visual progress indicators
- Phase completion summaries
- File creation notifications
- Real-time status updates

### 3. Interruption Handling
You can pause at any time:
```
Pantheon: Ready to proceed with Phase 2? (y/n):
You: pause

Pantheon: ‚è∏Ô∏è Session paused. Your progress has been saved.
      Resume anytime with '/gods resume'
```

### 4. Smart Resumption
```
You: /gods resume

Pantheon: Found paused session: Mobile AI Image Generator
      Progress: Phase 2 of 4 (40% complete)
      Last action: Created layout components
      
      Resume where you left off? (y/n):
```

## Interactive Commands

### During Execution
While Pantheon is working, you can:
- Type "pause" to save progress and stop
- Type "status" to see current progress
- Type "skip" to skip current step (with confirmation)
- Answer "n" to any continuation prompt to pause

### Choice Prompts
When presented with numbered options:
- Type the number (1-4) to select
- Type "help" for more information
- Type "back" to return to previous step

## Benefits

1. **Lower Learning Curve**: No need to memorize command sequences
2. **Faster Development**: Seamless flow reduces friction
3. **Better Context**: Pantheon maintains understanding throughout
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of issues with options
5. **Natural Experience**: Feels like pair programming with an expert

## Tips for Best Experience

1. **Be Specific**: During init, provide detailed requirements
2. **Trust the Flow**: Let Pantheon guide you through the process
3. **Review Checkpoints**: Take time at phase completions to review
4. **Use Pause**: Don't hesitate to pause and return later
5. **Provide Feedback**: Answer prompts thoughtfully for best results

## Comparison: Old vs New

### Old Flow (Multiple Commands)
```bash
/gods init
# Edit pantheon.md manually
/gods plan
/gods execute
/execute-prp pantheon-prp-20250120.md
```

### New Flow (Interactive)
```bash
/gods init
# Answer questions, everything else happens automatically
```

## Advanced Usage

### Skipping Steps
If you already have a pantheon.md file:
```bash
/gods plan
# Offers to proceed to implementation automatically
```

### Direct Execution
If you want to jump straight to coding:
```bash
/gods execute
# Still provides interactive options
```

### Custom Workflows
Create your own interactive workflows:
```bash
/workflow analysis-to-implementation
# Guided multi-agent collaboration
```

## Troubleshooting

### Session Issues
If something goes wrong:
```bash
/gods status     # Check current session
/gods reset      # Clear all sessions (with confirmation)
/gods resume     # Try to resume
```

### Getting Help
At any prompt:
- Type "help" for context-sensitive assistance
- Type "?" for available options
- Type "back" to go to previous step

## The pantheon.md File Format

The `pantheon.md` file is a structured way to define your project requirements:

```yaml
---
version: 1.0
project_type: "FastAPI Web Service"
author: "Your Name"
---

## FEATURE: User Authentication
Description of the authentication feature...

## FEATURE: Task Management
Description of task management feature...
Dependencies: User Authentication

## EXAMPLES:
- `./examples/auth_pattern.py`: Authentication example
- `./examples/crud_pattern.py`: CRUD operations example

## DOCUMENTATION:
- `https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/`: FastAPI documentation

## CONSTRAINTS:
- Must use PostgreSQL
- JWT tokens required
- Response time < 200ms

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
Additional context and requirements...
```

### Key Components

1. **YAML Frontmatter**: Contains metadata like version, project type, and author
2. **FEATURE Sections**: Each major feature gets its own section with dependencies
3. **EXAMPLES**: Links to code examples or patterns to follow
4. **DOCUMENTATION**: External resources and documentation links
5. **CONSTRAINTS**: Technical and business constraints
6. **OTHER CONSIDERATIONS**: Any additional context or requirements

### Integration with Existing Commands

When a `pantheon.md` file is present, existing commands automatically leverage it:

- **`/analyze`** - Considers all features and constraints from pantheon.md
- **`/orchestrate`** - Uses recommended team composition from pantheon.md analysis
- **`/generate-prp`** - Incorporates all pantheon.md content into the PRP

### Workflow Comparison

**Traditional CLI Workflow:**
```
/analyze "Build a task management API"
/orchestrate "Build a task management API"
/generate-prp "Build a task management API with auth"
```

**New pantheon.md Workflow:**
```
/gods init          # Create template interactively
# Edit pantheon.md with your requirements (optional)
/gods plan          # Analyze and plan
/gods execute       # Run orchestration and generation
```

The pantheon.md approach ensures all commands have complete context and requirements, leading to more accurate and comprehensive results.
