# Smart Routing Implementation Progress

## Week 1: Core Infrastructure ✅ Complete

### Days 1-2: Smart Router Foundation ✅
Created core infrastructure:
- `.claude/lib/smart-router.md` - Main routing logic with task analysis and agent matching
- `.claude/lib/smart-router-helpers.md` - Helper functions for complexity calculation, confidence scoring
- `.claude/lib/feature-flags.md` - Centralized feature flag management system
- `.claude/tests/smart-router.test.md` - Comprehensive unit test specifications

Key features implemented:
- TaskAnalysis and RoutingDecision interfaces
- Agent matching algorithm with weighted scoring
- Feature flag integration for safe rollout
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Days 3-4: Agent Capability Metadata ✅
Added capability metadata to all 10 agents:
- **Winston** (Architect): architecture-design:expert, system-design:expert
- **James** (Developer): implementation:expert, code-quality:expert
- **Elena** (QA): testing-strategy:expert, qa-automation:expert
- **Marcus** (Security): security-audit:expert, compliance:expert
- **John** (PM): product-planning:expert, requirements-analysis:expert
- **Sarah** (PO): user-stories:expert, prioritization:expert
- **Bob** (SM): scrum-process:expert, task-breakdown:expert
- **Sally** (UX): ux-design:expert, ui-patterns:expert
- **Pixel** (UI Healer): ui-quality:expert, visual-testing:expert
- **BMad Master**: orchestration:expert, meta-analysis:expert

Each agent now has:
- Domain expertise levels (novice/intermediate/advanced/expert)
- Capability ratings
- Complexity handling ranges
- Strong match patterns for routing
- Collaboration suggestions

### Day 5: Task Analyzer ✅
Created sophisticated task analysis system:
- `.claude/lib/task-analyzer.md` - Natural language processing for task understanding

Features:
- Advanced domain detection with weighted patterns
- Technology recognition (React, Node.js, AWS, etc.)
- Complexity scoring algorithm
- Capability extraction from context
- Duration estimation
- Intent recognition
- Metadata extraction (word count, priority, etc.)

## Week 2: Integration & Testing (Next Steps)

### Days 8-9: Create Routing Command
Need to create `/baco route` command that:
- Shows task analysis results
- Displays routing decision with confidence
- Allows manual override
- Provides alternative agents

### Days 10-11: Workflow Integration
Integrate smart routing with:
- Workflow engine for automatic routing
- Existing BACO commands
- Agent transformation system

### Day 12: Analytics & Monitoring
Build analytics system to track:
- Routing decisions and outcomes
- Agent utilization
- Success rates
- User overrides

### Days 13-14: Testing & Documentation
- End-to-end testing of routing scenarios
- Performance benchmarking
- User documentation
- Rollout planning

## Current State

### What's Working
1. **Core Routing Logic**: Complete algorithm for analyzing tasks and matching agents
2. **Agent Metadata**: All agents have comprehensive capability definitions
3. **Task Analysis**: Sophisticated NLP-based task understanding
4. **Feature Flags**: Safe rollout mechanism with granular control

### What's Next
1. Create the `/baco route` command for user interaction
2. Integrate with existing workflow engine
3. Add analytics and monitoring
4. Comprehensive testing and documentation

### Feature Flag Status
```javascript
SMART_ROUTING: {
  enabled: false,  // Still disabled until integration complete
  rolloutPercentage: 0,
  config: {
    ROUTING_PREVIEW_MODE: true,
    ALLOW_MANUAL_OVERRIDE: true,
    ROUTING_ANALYTICS_ENABLED: true,
    AUTO_ROUTE_THRESHOLD: 0.7,
    SUGGEST_COLLABORATION: true
  }
}
```

## Technical Achievements

### Routing Algorithm
- **40% weight**: Domain expertise matching
- **30% weight**: Capability matching
- **15% weight**: Pattern matching
- **15% weight**: Complexity handling

### Task Analysis Capabilities
- Detects 9 major domains (architecture, implementation, testing, etc.)
- Recognizes 15+ technologies
- Estimates complexity on 1-10 scale
- Classifies 6 task types
- Extracts 40+ capability requirements

### Agent Matching
- Scores agents based on multiple factors
- Suggests supporting agents for collaboration
- Provides confidence scores
- Offers alternative routing options

## Success Metrics (To Be Measured)
- [ ] 80%+ routing accuracy
- [ ] <100ms routing decision time
- [ ] 0 disruption to existing workflows
- [ ] Positive user feedback on transparency

## Risk Mitigation
- Feature flags prevent premature activation
- Fallback routing ensures system stability
- Manual override preserves user control
- Preview mode allows testing without execution

## Conclusion
Week 1 of Smart Routing implementation is complete with all core infrastructure in place. The system is ready for integration and testing in Week 2. The sophisticated task analysis and agent matching algorithms provide a strong foundation for intelligent task routing in BACO.
